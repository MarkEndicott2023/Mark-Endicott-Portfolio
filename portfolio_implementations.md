* read .claude/agents/portfolio-iteration-advisor
* read through resume drafts in the folder "resume\_drafts"
* construct a simplified web\_portfolio showcasing overall accromplishments
* Tailor descriptions for quantitative outputs and achievements
* Requirements:



  1. Layout \& Navigation



  * Use a tabbed layout with three tabs: Experience, Projects, About Mark (not one long page).



  Order within tabs:

  

  * About Mark: Professional summary → Skills.
  * Projects: Featured projects appear after Skills (cross-link allowed).
  * Omit the “Professional Skills” sidebar/box—skills live inline after the summary.



  2. Visual Design



  * Color palette: navy + mint.
  * No section boundary color (keep section dividers neutral/minimal).
  * Do not show the background box of each section. The section should blend in seamlessly with the white background. This includes the green border on the left.



  3. Skills Placement \& Tone



  * Immediately after the professional summary, showcase skills first.
  * Keep descriptions concise, emphasizing tools, methods, and quantifiable outcomes/metrics.



  4. Experience Content



  * Include food service roles under Experience.
  * Update dates:
    * Apollo role: ended September 2025.
    * Apollo house management project: ongoing.
    * Note: delivered one markdown report to the Spartan Housing Cooperative (SHC).
  * Read example_timeline.jpg
  * In the experience section, display a timeline of experience since the first entry to the last entry. Each point should be annotated with the experience title similar to the prior jpg image. 
    * In the boxes, use a line to separate workplace from role title.
    * Also display when the roles ended
    * Make sure that Apollo and MOTRE lab are separate.
    * Omit the "Apollo Housing" annotation box in this experience timeline. It is overlapping with the "Present" box.
  * Instead of bullet-points, structure the descriptions as summaries.
  * Bolden keywords that relate to skills.



  5. Projects Content


  * Above all other projects, display a timeline that copies the format of the one in the experience section.
    * Replace "Apollo Housing" with Apollo Cooperative and "Analytics Project" with "Chore Analytics."
  * Algorithmic Trading Bot
    * Tech: Python; explicitly mention ETL.
    * Started in May, 2025 and is ongoing (apply to timeline)
  * Bolden keywords that relate to skills.
  



  Pin assets (in "assets" folder):

  

  * trading\_bot\_altair\_vega\_graph.png → annotate: “Granular Price Data Using Vega-Altair”.
  * trading\_bot\_simple\_backtester\_code.py → annotate under “Project Artifacts” with note: example draft, not the code actually used.
  * Breaking Fragmentation (corrected spelling)
  * Tools: Analysis \& visualization in Excel (mention explicitly).
  * broad\_datathon\_visual.png -> annotate under: "Building a User-Friendly Dashboard"
  * broad\_datathon\_\*.pdf or \*.pbix -> annotate under: "Project Artifacts"
  * uuraf\_photo\_2.png → annotate: Final poster draft.
  * uuraf\_photo\_3.png → annotate: Precursor draft.
  * uuraf\_speadsheet.xlsx → annotate: "Project Artifact".
  * hack\_rare\_\* -> annotate: "Project Artifacts:"





  Event timing for context badges:

  

  * MSU Broad Datathon: September 2025.
  * Harvard Hackathon: March 2025.



  6. Coursework Section



  * Rename “Relevant Coursework:” → “Technical Courses:”.
  * From msu\_unofficial\_transcript\_101525.pdf, list the top 5-10 courses most aligned with a data professional.
  * Present as a neatly organized short list (not crammed), e.g., bullet list or compact two-column layout with course name → brief relevance.
  * I'm taking MTH 309 (Linear algebra) right now as well as ITM 311 (Systems Design and Analysis). Feel free to add these.



  7. Writing Guidelines (global)



  * Keep work experience bullets succinct and tool/skill-forward (e.g., Python, Excel, ETL, Altair/Vega), include numbers where possible (impacts, scale, speedups).
  * Ensure consistent spelling and naming:
  * “Breaking Fragmentation”, “Harvard Hackathon”, “occurred”, “palette”, “boundary”, “Experience”.
