The aim of this report is to highlight a finding of a rare mutation in the RAF1 gene in a six-year-old child evaluated for Noonan Syndrome. An Ampliseq Research Panel covering A2ML1, BRAF, CBL, HRAS, KRAS, MAP2K1, MAP2K2, NRAS, PTPN11, RAF1, RIT1, SHOC2, SOS1 and SPRED1 genes was used on the Ion Torrent platform. Out of 54 variants detected, a single nucleotide missense mutation c.483T>G in the RAF1 gene was classified as likely pathogenic, based on a single previous submission to Clinvar. Further investigations may shed light on the possible role of this variant in the pathogenesis of Noonan Syndrome and other RASopathies.",10.33602/mebm.3.1.7

A2ML1,HGNC:23336,Noonan syndrome,MONDO:0018997,Noonan Syndrome in South Africa: Clinical and Molecular Profiles,"Noonan Syndrome (NS) is a common autosomal dominant multisystem disorder, caused by mutations in more than 10 genes in the Ras/MAPK signaling pathway. Differential mutation frequencies are observed across populations. Clinical expressions of NS are highly variable and include short stature, distinctive craniofacial dysmorphism, cardiovascular abnormalities, and developmental delay. Little is known about phenotypic specificities and molecular characteristics of NS in Africa. The present study has investigated patients with NS in Cape Town (South Africa). Clinical features were carefully documented in a total of 26 patients. Targeted Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) was performed on 16 unrelated probands, using a multigene panel comprising 14 genes: PTPN11, SOS1, RIT1, A2ML1, BRAF, CBL, HRAS, KRAS, MAP2K1, MAP2K2, NRAS, RAF1, SHOC2, and SPRED1. The median age at diagnosis was 4.5 years (range: 1 month−51 years). Individuals of mixed-race ancestry were most represented (53.8%), followed by black Africans (30.8%). Our cohort revealed a lower frequency of pulmonary valve stenosis (34.6%) and a less severe developmental milestones phenotype. Molecular analysis found variants predicted to be pathogenic in 5 / 16 cases (31.2%). Among these mutations, two were previously reported: MAP2K1-c.389A>G (p.Tyr130Cys) and PTPN11 - c.1510A>G (p.Met504Val); three are novel: CBL-c.2520T>G (p.Cys840Trp), PTPN11- c.1496C>T (p.Ser499Phe), and MAP2K1- c.200A>C (p.Asp67Ala). Molecular dynamic simulations indicated that novel variants identified impact the stability and flexibility of their corresponding proteins. Genotype-phenotype correlations showed that clinical features of NS were more typical in patients with variants in MAP2K1. This first application of targeted NGS for the molecular diagnosis of NS in South Africans suggests that, while there is no major phenotypic difference compared to other populations, the distribution of genetic variants in NS in South Africans may be different.",10.3389/fgene.2019.00333

Clinical presentations are similar, featured with typical facial features, short stature, intellectual disability, ectodermal abnormalities, congenital heart diseases, chest & skeletal deformity and delayed puberty. During past decades, molecular etiologies of RASopathies have been growingly discovered. The functional perturbations of the RAS-mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway are resulted from the mutation of more than 20 genes (PTPN11, SOS1, RAF1, SHOC2, BRAF, KRAS, NRAS, HRAS, MEK1, MEK2, CBL, SOS2, RIT, RRAS, RASA2, SPRY1, LZTR1, MAP3K8, MYST4, A2ML1, RRAS2). The PTPN11 (40-50%), SOS1 (10-20%), RAF1 (3-17%), and RIT1 (5-9%) mutations are common in NS patients.

A2ML1,HGNC:23336,Noonan syndrome,MONDO:0018997,Noonan and LEOPARD syndrome in zebrafish : molecular mechanisms and cardiac development,"This thesis describes the use of zebrafish to study Noonan-(NS) and LEOPARD syndromes (LS), two autosomal dominant disorders with overlapping symptoms, caused by mutations in protein-tyrosine phosphatase, non-receptor type 11 (PTPN11). Intriguingly, while NS mutations result in a more ‘active’ state of Shp2, LS mutations give rise to a PTP defective protein. 

First, we studied the role of ptpn11 in zebrafish embryonic development. Whereas ptpn11a is crucial for development ptpn11b seems dispensible.

Moreover, using phoshoproteomics we show hypo- and hypertyrosyl phosphorylation of Fer kinase and PZR (Protein zero related), respectively and study their roles as (potential) interacting proteins in the etiology of both NS and LS. 

Defective heart development is a prominent symptom of NS and LS. Embryos expressing NS and LS Shp2 showed impaired expression of laterality markers, impaired cilia function in Kupffer’s vesicle and at later stages, heart function defects. 

Finally we identified several mutations in Alpha-2-Macroglobulin-Like-1 (A2ML1) in patients diagnosed with NS. Functional characterization of these mutations in zebrafish showed NS-like developmental defects. This is the first example of an extracellular factor in a disorder clinically related to NS and LS, providing potential new leads for better understanding of the molecular basis of these developmental syndromes.",N/A

The subtype isolated punctate PPK is caused by heterozygous variants in AAGAB. We investigated if the variant AAGAB c.370C>T, p.Arg124Ter in patients with punctate PPK in the Region of Southern Denmark represented a founder variant and estimated the age to the most recent common ancestor. We performed haplotype analysis on samples from 20 patients diagnosed with punctate PPK and the AAGAB c.370C>T, p.Arg124Ter variant. Using the Gamma Method, we calculated the years to the most recent common ancestor. We also explored the presence of the variant in other populations through literature and databases (HGMD, ClinVar, and gnomAD). Our analysis revealed a shared haplotype of 3.0 Mb, suggesting shared ancestry. The ancestral haplogroup was estimated to an age of 12.1 generations (CI: 4.9–20.3) equivalent to approximately 339 years (CI: 137–568). This study confirms that the frequently observed variant AAGAB c.370C>T, p.Arg124Ter in punctate PPK among patients in the Region of Southern Denmark is caused by a founder variant. We recommend testing for the variant as initial screening in our region and potentially for all Danish patients presenting with punctate PPK.",10.1111/cge.14486

Mutations have been found at 2 loci, on chromosomes 15q22-15q24 and 8q24.13-8q24.21. We recently identified mutations in 3 families, in the AAGAB gene on 15q, which encodes the alpha- and gamma-adaptin-binding protein p34. The current study examined 14 additional families, comprising a total of 26 affected individuals and identified 8 novel mutations in 9 families. In one family a mutation that was present only in the affected individuals was found, and in 4 other families, previously reported mutations were found (1, 2). These results confirm the role of AAGAB in PPKP1. Our findings suggest that there is no correlation with age, but with mechanical factors. No additional obvious genotype-phenotype correlation was observed, even when comparing different types of mutations.

In 2012, heterozygous loss‐of‐function mutations in the AAGAB gene were identified as the cause of this disorder. To date, 51 AAGAB mutations have been reported in families with PPPK1, but clear genotype–phenotype correlations have not been established yet. In this report, we identified four Japanese patients with PPPK1 from two families with an identical novel heterozygous AAGAB mutation. All patients showed hyperkeratotic papules only on the soles. Direct sequencing analysis of the AAGAB gene using peripheral blood‐derived genomic DNA samples revealed that all of the patients carried a heterozygous 1‐bp substitution (c.844G>A, p.Glu282Lys) in exon 9, leading to a missense change. Since all patients with the same missense mutation showed a mild phenotype limited to the soles, there is thought to be a genotype–phenotype correlation regarding this mutation. The c.844G>A mutation is a known single‐nucleotide polymorphism with a minor allele frequency of 0.000012. Because of its mild symptoms, individuals with this mutation can be misdiagnosed with clavus or verruca vulgaris; this suggests that there may be a high incidence of mild symptoms of skin lesions found only on the soles in patients with PPPK1. Therefore, it is necessary to consider this disease when keratotic papules are found on the soles.",10.1111/1346-8138.16162

PPKP1 is clinically characterised by multiple punctate hyperkeratotic papules affecting the palmar and plantar skin, with considerable phenotypic variation among patients (2). These circumscribed papules gradually coalesce and increase in number with age (2). The lesions typically start to appear in early adolescence but sometimes develop later in life. In 2012, linkage analysis and whole-exome sequencing identified heterozygous null mutations within AAGAB as a cause of PPKP1 (2, 3). AAGAB encodes αand γ-adaptin binding protein p34, which is involved in clathrin-mediated vesicle transport (2). Loss-of-function mutations in AAGAB result in haploinsufficiency of p34 (2). To date, 20 AAGAB null variants have been identified in Scottish, Irish, English, German, Tunisian, Chinese Mexican and Japanese populations (2–8).

Rubegni et al. reported one patient with Meige hereditary lymphoedema presenting with alopecia of the lateral third of eyebrows and conjunctival oedema. Alopecia of the lateral third of the eyebrows is a common sign of obstruction in lymphatic drainage of the periorbital region. Herein, the underlying pathology is a nerve sheath tumour which presumably impairs lymphatic drainage and therefore causes a mild periorbital oedema and milphosis.

PPPK1 is an autosomal dominant skin disease caused by AAGAB mutations. It has been suggested that PPPK1 may be associated with an increased predisposition to systemic malignancies. Objectives: To evaluate the presence of AAGAB mutations in Canadian families with PPPK1 and the possible increased predisposition to systemic malignancies. Methods: Eighteen unrelated Canadian families with PPPK1 were recruited for this study. Genomic DNA was extracted from saliva and PCR amplification was performed for all AAGAB exons and exon/intron junctions. PCR products were sequenced and analyzed for mutations. A family history of malignancy was obtained from the index case and, when possible, from other family members. Results: We have identified 5 heterozygous AAGAB loss of function mutations in 11 families. The mutation c.370 C>T, p.Arg124* was the most prevalent and was identified in 6 families. A splice site mutation, c.451+3delAAGT, was identified in 2 families. The other mutations c.473delG, p.Gly158Glufs*0; c.550-551insAAT, p.Gly183*; and c.505-506 dupAA, p.Asn169Lysfs*6 were each identified in 1 family. Different cancers were reported in 11 families (Table 1 and Supplemental Figure S1). Conclusions: AAGAB mutations were found in 11 of 18 families with PPPK1. In some families there appears to be an association with cancer.",10.1177/1203475419878161

Four genes encoding an aminoacyl‐tRNA synthetase (ARS) have been implicated in CMT disease. ARSs are ubiquitously expressed, essential enzymes that ligate amino acids to cognate tRNA molecules. Recently, a p.Arg329His variant in the alanyl‐tRNA synthetase (AARS) gene was found to segregate with dominant axonal CMT type 2N (CMT2N) in two French families; however, the functional consequence of this mutation has not been determined. To investigate the role of AARS in CMT, we performed a mutation screen of the AARS gene in patients with peripheral neuropathy. Our results showed that p.Arg329His AARS also segregated with CMT disease in a large Australian family. Aminoacylation and yeast viability assays showed that p.Arg329His AARS severely reduces enzyme activity. Genotyping analysis indicated that this mutation arose on three distinct haplotypes, and the results of bisulfite sequencing suggested that methylation‐mediated deamination of a CpG dinucleotide gives rise to the recurrent p.Arg329His AARS mutation. Together, our data suggest that impaired tRNA charging plays a role in the molecular pathology of CMT2N, and that patients with CMT should be directly tested for the p.Arg329His AARS mutation.

Currently, there is no cure for CMT2N. Here, we found that all five AlaRS mutations in the aminoacylation domain can interact with neuropilin-1 (Nrp1), which is consistent with our previous findings. Interestingly, three of these mutations did not affect alanine activation activity. We then performed a high-throughput screen of 2000 small molecules targeting the prevalent R329H mutant. Using thermal stability assays (TSA), biolayer interferometry (BLI), ATP consumption, and proteolysis assays, we identified Tanshinone I as a compound that binds to and modifies the conformation of the R329H mutant and other CMT-related AlaRS mutants interacting with Nrp1. Molecular docking and dynamic simulation studies further clarified Tanshinone I’s binding mode, indicating its potential against various AlaRS mutants. Furthermore, co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) and pull-down assays showed that Tanshinone I significantly reduces the binding of AlaRS mutants to Nrp1. Collectively, these findings suggest that Tanshinone I, by altering the conformation of mutant proteins, disrupts the pathological interaction between AlaRS CMT mutants and Nrp1, potentially restoring normal Nrp1 function. This makes Tanshinone I a promising therapeutic candidate for CMT2N.",10.3390/ijms252011184

ARSs are enzymes that charge tRNA molecules with cognate amino acids. Pathogenic variants in asparaginyl-tRNA synthetase (NARS1) cause a neurological phenotype combining developmental delay, ataxia and demyelinating peripheral neuropathy. NARS1 has not yet been linked to axonal Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. Exome sequencing of patients with inherited peripheral neuropathies revealed three previously unreported heterozygous NARS1 variants in three families. Clinical and electrophysiological details were assessed. We further characterized all three variants in a yeast complementation model and used a knock-in mouse model to study variant p.Ser461Phe. All three variants (p.Met236del, p.Cys342Tyr and p.Ser461Phe) co-segregate with the sensorimotor axonal neuropathy phenotype. Yeast complementation assays show that none of the three NARS1 variants support wild-type yeast growth when tested in isolation (i.e. in the absence of a wild-type copy of NARS1), consistent with a loss-of-function effect. Similarly, the homozygous knock-in mouse model (p.Ser461Phe/Ser472Phe in mouse) also demonstrated loss-of-function characteristics. We present three previously unreported NARS1 variants segregating with a sensorimotor neuropathy phenotype in three families. Functional studies in yeast and mouse support variant pathogenicity. Thus, NARS1 is the seventh ARS implicated in dominant axonal Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, further stressing that all dimeric ARSs should be evaluated for Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease.",10.1093/braincomms/fcae070

Patients with CMT1A typically have slowed nerve conduction velocities (NCVs), reduced compound motor and sensory nerve action potentials (CMAPs and SNAPs), distal weakness, sensory loss and decreased reflexes. In order to understand further the molecular pathogenesis of CMT1A, as well as to determine which features correlate with neurological dysfunction and might thus be amenable to treatment, we evaluated the clinical and electrophysiological phenotype in 42 patients with CMT1A. In these patients, muscle weakness, CMAP amplitudes and motor unit number estimates correlated with clinical disability, while motor NCV did not. In addition, loss of joint position sense and reduction in SNAP amplitudes also correlated with clinical disability, while sensory NCV did not. Taken together, these data strongly support the hypothesis that neurological dysfunction and clinical disability in CMT1A are caused by loss or damage to large calibre motor and sensory axons. Therapeutic approaches to ameliorate disability in CMT1A, as in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and other neurodegenerative diseases, should thus be directed towards preventing axonal degeneration and/or promoting axonal regeneration.",10.1093/BRAIN/123.7.1516

MFN2 mutations result in profound mitochondrial abnormalities, but the mechanism underlying axonal pathology is unknown. SARM1, the central executioner of axon degeneration, can induce neuropathy and is activated by dysfunctional mitochondria. We tested the role of SARM1 in a rat model carrying a dominant CMT2A mutation (Mfn2H361Y) that exhibits progressive dying-back axonal degeneration, NMJ abnormalities, muscle atrophy, and mitochondrial abnormalities, all hallmarks of the human disease. We generated Sarm1 knockout and Mfn2H361Y, Sarm1 double mutant rats and find that deletion of SARM1 rescues axonal, synaptic, and muscle phenotypes, demonstrating that SARM1 induces much of the neuropathology in this model. Despite the presence of mutant Mfn2 protein in these double mutant rats, loss of SARM1 also dramatically suppressed many mitochondrial defects, including the number, size, and cristae density defects of synaptic mitochondria. This surprising finding indicates that dysfunctional mitochondria activate SARM1, and activated SARM1 feeds back on mitochondria to exacerbate mitochondrial pathology. As such, this work identifies SARM1 inhibition as an exciting therapeutic candidate for the treatment of CMT2A and other neurodegenerative diseases with prominent mitochondrial pathology.",10.1101/2022.05.17.492364

AARS2,HGNC:21022,mitochondrial disease,MONDO:0044970,PCBP1 regulates alternative splicing of AARS2 in congenital cardiomyopathy,"Alanyl-transfer RNA synthetase 2 (AARS2) is a nuclear encoded mitochondrial tRNA synthetase that is responsible for charging of tRNA-Ala with alanine during mitochondrial translation. Homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the Aars2 gene, including those affecting its splicing, are linked to infantile cardiomyopathy in humans. However, how Aars2 regulates heart development, and the underlying molecular mechanism of heart disease remains unknown. Here, we found that poly(rC) binding protein 1 (PCBP1) interacts with the Aars2 transcript to mediate its alternative splicing and is critical for the expression and function of Aars2. Cardiomyocyte-specific deletion of Pcbp1 in mice resulted in defects in heart development that are reminiscent of human congenital cardiac defects, including noncompaction cardiomyopathy and a disruption of the cardiomyocyte maturation trajectory. Loss of Pcbp1 led to an aberrant alternative splicing and a premature termination of Aars2 in cardiomyocytes. Additionally, Aars2 mutant mice with exon-16 skipping recapitulated heart developmental defects observed in Pcbp1 mutant mice. Mechanistically, we found dysregulated gene and protein expression of the oxidative phosphorylation pathway in both Pcbp1 and Aars2 mutant hearts; these date provide further evidence that the infantile hypertrophic cardiomyopathy associated with the disorder oxidative phosphorylation defect type 8 (COXPD8) is mediated by Aars2. Our study therefore identifies Pcbp1 and Aars2 as critical regulators of heart development and provides important molecular insights into the role of disruptions in metabolism on congenital heart defects.",10.1101/2023.05.18.540420
AARS2,HGNC:21022,mitochondrial disease,MONDO:0044970,Structural modeling of tissue-specific mitochondrial alanyl-tRNA synthetase (AARS2) defects predicts differential effects on aminoacylation,"The accuracy of mitochondrial protein synthesis is dependent on the coordinated action of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (mtARSs) and the mitochondrial DNA-encoded tRNAs. The recent advances in whole-exome sequencing have revealed the importance of the mtARS proteins for mitochondrial pathophysiology since nearly every nuclear gene for mtARS (out of 19) is now recognized as a disease gene for mitochondrial disease. Typically, defects in each mtARS have been identified in one tissue-specific disease, most commonly affecting the brain, or in one syndrome. However, mutations in the AARS2 gene for mitochondrial alanyl-tRNA synthetase (mtAlaRS) have been reported both in patients with infantile-onset cardiomyopathy and in patients with childhood to adulthood-onset leukoencephalopathy. We present here an investigation of the effects of the described mutations on the structure of the synthetase, in an effort to understand the tissue-specific outcomes of the different mutations. The mtAlaRS differs from the other mtARSs because in addition to the aminoacylation domain, it has a conserved editing domain for deacylating tRNAs that have been mischarged with incorrect amino acids. We show that the cardiomyopathy phenotype results from a single allele, causing an amino acid change R592W in the editing domain of AARS2, whereas the leukodystrophy mutations are located in other domains of the synthetase. Nevertheless, our structural analysis predicts that all mutations reduce the aminoacylation activity of the synthetase, because all mtAlaRS domains contribute to tRNA binding for aminoacylation. According to our model, the cardiomyopathy mutations severely compromise aminoacylation whereas partial activity is retained by the mutation combinations found in the leukodystrophy patients. These predictions provide a hypothesis for the molecular basis of the distinct tissue-specific phenotypic outcomes.",10.3389/fgene.2015.00021

Novel (Ovario) leukodystrophy related to a mutation on mitochondrial alanine amino acyl tRNA synthetase gene (AARS2) is a rare condition that could be misdiagnosed as multiple sclerosis. Mutations in the AARS2 gene have been found in a severe form of infantile cardiomyopathy and recently it was described in a small group of patients with progressive leukoencephalopathy and, in females with ovarian failure.
Case
A 16 year old male evaluated at the Multiple Sclerosis Clinic presented with progressive gait impairment and abnormal brain MRI. Parents were born in China with no reported perinatal complications. He was “clumsy” as a child, but met developmental milestones. He presented with one year history of hand tremors, left leg weakness, recurrent falls, irritability and insomnia. MRI of the brain showed patchy T2/FLAIR hyperintense lesions in the periventricular area extending throughout the corpus callosum with posterior predominance. Several lesions demonstrated restricted diffusion. Spinal cord MRI was normal. Examination showed downbeat nystagmus, cogwheel rigidity, lower extremity hyperreflexia, left side Babinski and dysmetria with ipsilateral weakness. No signs of cardiomyopathy were present. Laboratory findings were negative for long chain fatty acid, lysosomal enzymes, GFAP, organic amino acids, proteolipid protein 1, ANA, Sjogren9s antibodies, and NMO IgG. CSF was negative for infection and no oligoclonal bands were detected. Nerve conduction velocity study was normal. AARS2 sequence was detected with a heterozygous mutation C.706dupC and a novel variant c.452T>C.
Conclusion:
Novel (Ovario) leukodystrophy related to a mutation on AARS2 gene is a rare condition that can mimic multiple sclerosis. Ataxia, spasticity and cognitive decline are the main features with subsequent involvement of pyramidal tracts. Our patient was previously misdiagnosed with multiple sclerosis and subsequently the genome sequencing revealed a novel mutation. This case highlights the importance of considering other diagnoses when assessing CNS demyelination in adolescents and young adults. Disclosure: Dr. Rosales has nothing to disclose.

ALSP is often misdiagnosed as other diseases due to its rarity and various clinical presentations such as Parkinsonism, pyramidal signs, cognitive impairment and/or psychiatric symptoms. We describe an autopsy case of ALSP with a CSF1R mutation. A 61-year-old woman presented insidious-onset gait difficulty for 12 years since her age of 49, and premature ovarian failure since her age of 35. At initial hospital visit, brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed hydrocephalus. Initially, Parkinson's syndrome was diagnosed, and she was prescribed L-dopa/carbidopa because of spasticity and rigidity of extremities, which had worsened. Subsequently, severe neuropsychiatric symptoms and cognitive impairment developed and radiologically, features of leukoencephalopathy or leukodystrophy were detected. She showed a down-hill course and died, 12 years after initial diagnosis. At autopsy, the brain showed severe symmetric atrophy of bilateral white matter, paper-thin corpus callosum, thin internal capsule, and marked hydrocephalus. Microscopically, diffuse loss of white matter, relatively preserved subcortical U-fibers, and many eosinophilic bulbous neuroaxonal spheroids were noted, but there was no calcification. Pigmented glia with brown cytoplasmic pigmentation were readily found in the white matter, which were positive for Periodic acid-Schiff, p62, and CD163 stains, but almost negative for CD68. Whole-exome and Sanger sequencing revealed a CSF1R mutation (c.2539G>A, p.Glu847Lys) which was reported in prior one ALSP case. This example demonstrates that ALSP could be associated with premature ovarian failure.",10.5607/en.2019.28.1.119

However, due to the exceptional complexity of these metabolic disorders and the intricate relationship between gut microbes, it is difficult to achieve an ideal therapeutic effect in a specific metabolic disorder using only a single engineered strain. In this work, we proposed a probiotic cocktail strategy by engineering two cascade metabolic bacteria to treat hyperlysinemia, an inherited lysine metabolic disorder with loss of α-aminoadipate semialdehyde synthase (AASS) activity. A probiotic E. coli Nissle 1917 strain EcNT (pTLS) with a heterologous enzyme pathway in Saccharomyces cerevisiae was engineered to metabolize the excess lysine. Another one EcNT (pK25) was engineered to consume the products of lysine metabolism. The bacterial cocktail enables the maintenance of a metabolic cascade with AASS-like functional activity to maintain the blood lysine concentrations and downstream metabolites. In vitro experimental results showed that the cocktail bacteria had a better metabolic capacity and metabolites balance at a ratio of EcNT (pTLS) and EcNT (pK25) of 1:2. Feeding of the cocktail bacteria to the mouse model effectively reduced the concentration of lysine and balanced saccharopine in the plasma of hyperlysinemia-like mice. These findings not only provide a promising strategy of probiotic stains for the treatment of hyperlysinemia but also highlight the potential of engineered cascade cocktails to intervene and even cure other inherited metabolic diseases.",10.3389/fmicb.2024.1366017

AASS,HGNC:17366,hyperlysinemia,MONDO:0009388,"Identification of the alpha-aminoadipic semialdehyde synthase gene, which is defective in familial hyperlysinemia.","The first two steps in the mammalian lysine-degradation pathway are catalyzed by lysine-ketoglutarate reductase and saccharopine dehydrogenase, respectively, resulting in the conversion of lysine to alpha-aminoadipic semialdehyde. Defects in one or both of these activities result in familial hyperlysinemia, an autosomal recessive condition characterized by hyperlysinemia, lysinuria, and variable saccharopinuria. In yeast, lysine-ketoglutarate reductase and saccharopine dehydrogenase are encoded by the LYS1 and LYS9 genes, respectively, and we searched the available sequence databases for their human homologues. We identified a single cDNA that encoded an apparently bifunctional protein, with the N-terminal half similar to that of yeast LYS1 and with the C-terminal half similar to that of yeast LYS9. This bifunctional protein has previously been referred to as ""alpha-aminoadipic semialdehyde synthase,"" and we have tentatively designated this gene ""AASS."" The AASS cDNA contains an open reading frame of 2,781 bp predicted to encode a 927-amino-acid-long protein. The gene has been sequenced and contains 24 exons scattered over 68 kb and maps to chromosome 7q31.3. Northern blot analysis revealed the presence of several transcripts in all tissues examined, with the highest expression occurring in the liver. We sequenced the genomic DNA from a single patient with hyperlysinemia (JJa). The patient is the product of a consanguineous mating and is homozygous for an out-of-frame 9-bp deletion in exon 15, which results in a premature stop codon at position 534 of the protein. On the basis of these and other results, we propose that AASS catalyzes the first two steps of the major lysine-degradation pathway in human cells and that inactivating mutations in the AASS gene are a cause of hyperlysinemia.",10.1086/302919

Although both forms of hyperlysinemia display biochemical phenotypes of questionable clinical significance, an association between neurologic disorder and a pronounced biochemical abnormality remains a challenging clinical question. Here, we report that Aass mutant male and female mice carrying the R65Q mutation in α-ketoglutarate reductase (LKR) domain have an elevated cerebral lysine level and a normal brain development, whereas the Aass mutant mice carrying the G489E mutation in saccharopine dehydrogenase (SDH) domain exhibit elevations of both cerebral lysine and saccharopine levels and a smaller brain with defective neuronal development. Mechanistically, the accumulated saccharopine, but not lysine, leads to impaired neuronal development by inhibiting the neurotrophic effect of glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (GPI). While extracellular supplementation of GPI restores defective neuronal development caused by G498E mutation in SDH of Aass. Altogether, our findings not only unravel the requirement for saccharopine degradation in neuronal development, but also provide the mechanistic insights for understanding the neurometabolic disorder of hyperlysinemia-II.

Cells were antibiotic selected for stable transfection of 2 plasmids that express different short hairpin RNA sequences for AASS knockdown. Compared with the wild-type cell line, AASS mRNA abundance was reduced 79.0 +/- 6.4% (P < 0.05), resulting in a 29.8 +/- 5.2% (P < 0.05) reduction in AASS protein abundance, 41.3 +/- 10.0% (P < 0.05) less LKR activity, and a reduction in lysine oxidation by 50.7 +/- 11.8%. To determine the effect of AASS knockdown on the lysine requirement, cells were grown in media containing 12.5, 25.0, 50.0, 100, or 200 micromol/L lysine. Using a segmented model approach for growth rate analysis, the lysine requirement of the cell line with AASS silencing was 43.4 +/- 1.7 micromol/L, approximately 26% lower (P < 0.05), than the lysine requirement of the wild-type cell line. These results indicate AASS knockdown decreases the lysine requirement of the cell via a reduction of lysine catabolism through the saccharopine pathway, providing the initial proof in principle that RNAi can be used to reduce the nutrient requirement of a system.",N/A
AASS,HGNC:17366,hyperlysinemia,MONDO:0009388,α‐Aminoadipate δ‐semialdehyde synthase mRNA knockdown reduces the lysine requirement of a murine hepatic cell line,"α‐Aminoadipate δ‐semialdehyde synthase (AASS) is the bifunctional enzyme containing the lysine α‐ketoglutarate reductase (LKR) and saccharopine dehydrogenase activities responsible for the first two steps in the irreversible catabolism of lysine. A rare disease in humans, hyperlysinemia, can be caused by very low LKR activity and, as expected, reduces the lysine “requirement” of the individual. This concept was applied to a murine hepatic cell line (ATCC, FL83B) utilizing RNA interference to achieve AASS mRNA knockdown. Cells were antibiotic selected for stable transfection of two plasmids that express different short hairpin RNA sequences for AASS knockdown. The AASS mRNA was silenced 82 ± 3% (p<0.05) compared to wild type, however western blotting indicated that AASS protein abundance was not different. To determine the lysine requirement, cells were grown in media containing 0.0, 12.5, 25.0, 50.0, 100, or 200 μM lysine. Using a NLIN SAS segmented model approach for growth rate analysis, the lysine requirement of the cell line with AASS mRNA knockdown was 45.0 ± 6.0 μM, approximately 50% lower (p<0.05) than the lysine requirement of the wild type cell line. These results indicate that reducing the AASS mRNA decreases the lysine requirement of the cell, presumably via a reduction in lysine catabolism through the saccharopine pathway.",10.1096/FASEBJ.21.5.A162
AASS,HGNC:17366,hyperlysinemia,MONDO:0009388,"An inhibitory mechanism of AasS, an exogenous fatty acid scavenger: Implications for re-sensitization of FAS II antimicrobials","Antimicrobial resistance is an ongoing “one health” challenge of global concern. The acyl-ACP synthetase (termed AasS) of the zoonotic pathogen Vibrio harveyi recycles exogenous fatty acid (eFA), bypassing the requirement of type II fatty acid synthesis (FAS II), a druggable pathway. A growing body of bacterial AasS-type isoenzymes compromises the clinical efficacy of FAS II-directed antimicrobials, like cerulenin. Very recently, an acyl adenylate mimic, C10-AMS, was proposed as a lead compound against AasS activity. However, the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood. Here we present two high-resolution cryo-EM structures of AasS liganded with C10-AMS inhibitor (2.33 Å) and C10-AMP intermediate (2.19 Å) in addition to its apo form (2.53 Å). Apart from our measurements for C10-AMS’ Ki value of around 0.6 μM, structural and functional analyses explained how this inhibitor interacts with AasS enzyme. Unlike an open state of AasS, ready for C10-AMP formation, a closed conformation is trapped by the C10-AMS inhibitor. Tight binding of C10-AMS blocks fatty acyl substrate entry, and therefore inhibits AasS action. Additionally, this intermediate analog C10-AMS appears to be a mixed-type AasS inhibitor. In summary, our results provide the proof of principle that inhibiting salvage of eFA by AasS reverses the FAS II bypass. This facilitates the development of next-generation anti-bacterial therapeutics, esp. the dual therapy consisting of C10-AMS scaffold derivatives combined with certain FAS II inhibitors.",10.1371/journal.ppat.1012376
AASS,HGNC:17366,hyperlysinemia,MONDO:0009388,Consumer-Grade Aerial-Aquatic Speedy Scanner (AASS) for Efficient Underwater Monitoring with Deep Learning,"Traditional marine monitoring techniques, such as line intercept transects, are often inefficient. While contemporary studies utilize autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) and the novel Portable Speedy Sea Scanner (P-SSS) to enhance marine monitoring, their widespread adoption is hindered by high costs and labor-intensive operations, with the data quality often failing to justify the investment. This study introduces a novel self-designed amphibious unmanned aerial vehicle (AASS), integrated with deep learning technology, which combines aerial and aquatic imaging capabilities. It surpasses traditional towed underwater survey tools and AUVs in ecological monitoring effectiveness. The research presents the AASS, enhanced with Super-Resolution Reconstruction (SRR) and an improved YOLOv8 detection network. The AASS system significantly improves data acquisition efficiency, capturing high-resolution images that precisely identify and categorize underwater targets. The SRR technique addresses issues like motion blur and low resolution, enhancing the YOLOv8 model's detection accuracy. Notably, the RCAN model achieved the highest mean average precision (mAP) of 78.6% for detecting reconstructed underwater images, with a x4 magnification in image quality showing superior mAP compared to the Bicubic method. These results affirm the efficacy of the proposed method in enhancing underwater ecological monitoring.",10.1109/OCEANS55160.2024.10753747

This study aimed to identify key molecular networks linking mitochondrial and immune pathways to DKD progression, with a focus on uncovering biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Methods We conducted an integrative analysis of human DKD cohorts (GSE30122, GSE96804) using weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to identify gene modules enriched for immune response genes and mitochondrial pathways (from MitoCarta3.0). Machine learning algorithms were employed to prioritize key biomarkers for further investigation. Experimental validation was performed using a DKD rat model. Results WGCNA revealed significant gene modules associated with immune responses and mitochondrial functions. Machine learning analysis highlighted two central biomarkers: aminoadipate-semialdehyde synthase (AASS) and caspase-3 (CASP3). In the DKD rat model, elevated levels of AASS and CASP3 were found to correlate with increased oxidative stress. Mechanistically, AASS was shown to drive mitochondrial damage via lysine metabolism, while CASP3 amplified inflammatory apoptosis pathways. Conclusions Our findings establish AASS and CASP3 as dual biomarkers and therapeutic targets, bridging mitochondrial-immune crosstalk to DKD pathogenesis. This multi-omics framework provides actionable insights for targeting kidney damage in diabetes.",10.1080/0886022X.2025.2465811

The disorder is characterised by epileptic encephalopathy, hypersomnoloscnec, movement disorders, and tone changes. Here, we report a 4-year-6-month-old boy child born to non-consanguineous marriage with a normal birth history presented with global developmental delay, refractory seizures, and increased sleep. On examination showed normal anthropometry with mild dysmorphism. Neurological examination showed autistic features and spasticity with brisk deep tendon reflexes. On investigation, electroencephalography showed multifocal epileptiform discharges with secondary generalisation, and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed mild hyperintensity of the superior cerebellum. Exome sequencing identified compound heterozygous variants in the ABAT gene and segregates with the condition in the family.

It is characterized by severe psychomotor retardation, early-onset epileptic encephalopathy, intractable seizures, hypotonia, hyperreflexia, movement disorder, hypersomnolence, and early childhood mortality. It is associated with elevated free GABA in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), GABA-T deficiency in cultured lymphoblasts, hypomyelination on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and elevated GABA level in the basal ganglia on proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). Only 14 cases have been published in the literature.

In this study, we investigate the analyte changes associated with 4-aminobutyrate aminotransferase (ABAT, GABA transaminase) deficiency and treatments that affect GABA metabolism. GABA-transaminase deficiency is a rare neurodevelopmental and neurometabolic disorder caused by mutations in ABAT and resulting in accumulation of GABA in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). For that reason, measurement of GABA in CSF is currently the primary approach to diagnosis. GABA-transaminase deficiency results in severe developmental delay with intellectual disability, seizures, and movement disorder, and is often associated with death in childhood. Using an untargeted metabolomics platform, we analyzed EDTA plasma, urine, and CSF specimens from four individuals with GABA-transaminase deficiency to identify biomarkers by comparing the biochemical profile of individual patient samples to a pediatric-centric population cohort. Metabolomic analyses of over 1,000 clinical plasma samples revealed a rich source of biochemical information. Three out of four patients showed significantly elevated levels of the molecule 2-pyrrolidinone (Z-score ≥ 2) in plasma, and whole exome sequencing revealed variants of uncertain significance in ABAT. Additionally, these same patients also had elevated levels of succinimide or its ring-opened form, succinamic acid, in plasma, urine, and CSF and/or homocarnosine in urine and CSF. In the analysis of clinical EDTA plasma samples, the levels of succinamic acid and 2-pyrrolidinone showed a high level of correlation (R = 0.72), indicating impairment in GABA metabolism and further supporting the association with GABA-transaminase deficiency and the pathogenicity of the ABAT variants. Further analysis of metabolomic data across our patient population revealed the association of elevated levels of 2-pyrrolidinone with administration of vigabatrin, a commonly used anti-seizure medication and a known inhibitor of GABA-transaminase. These data indicate that anti-seizure medications may alter the biochemical and metabolomic data, potentially impacting the interpretation and diagnosis for the patient. Further, these data demonstrate the power of combining broad scale genotyping and phenotyping technologies to diagnose inherited neurometabolic disorders and support the use of metabolic phenotyping of plasma to screen for GABA-transaminase deficiency.",10.3389/fnins.2019.00394

This register-based cohort study reviews patients with ABCA3 lung disease who survived beyond the age of 1 year. Method Over a 21-year period, patients diagnosed as chILD due to ABCA3 deficiency were identified from the Kids Lung Register database. 44 patients survived beyond the first year of life and their long-term clinical course, oxygen supplementation and pulmonary function were reviewed. Chest CT and histopathology were scored blindly. Results At the end of the observation period, median age was 6.3 years (IQR: 2.8–11.7) and 36/44 (82%) were still alive without transplantation. Patients who had never received supplemental oxygen therapy survived longer than those persistently required oxygen supplementation (9.7 (95% CI 6.7 to 27.7) vs 3.0 years (95% CI 1.5 to 5.0), p=0.0126). Interstitial lung disease was clearly progressive over time based on lung function (forced vital capacity % predicted absolute loss −1.1% /year) and on chest CT (increasing cystic lesions in those with repetitive imaging). Lung histology pattern were variable (chronic pneumonitis of infancy, non-specific interstitial pneumonia, and desquamative interstitial pneumonia). In 37/44 subjects, the ABCA3 sequence variants were missense variants, small insertions or deletions with in-silico tools predicting some residual ABCA3 transporter function.

Biallelic pathogenic ABCA3 variants cause severe neonatal respiratory distress syndrome or childhood interstitial lung disease. However, ABCA3 genotype alone does not explain the diversity in disease presentation, severity, and progression. Additionally, monoallelic ABCA3 variants have been reported in infants and children with ABCA3‐deficient phenotypes. The effects of most ABCA3 variants identified in patients have not been characterized at the RNA level. ABCA3 allele‐specific expression occurs in some cell types due to epigenetic regulation. We obtained lung tissue at transplant or autopsy from 16 infants and children with ABCA3 deficiency due to compound heterozygous ABCA3 variants for biologic characterization of the predicted effects of ABCA3 variants at the RNA level and determination of ABCA3 allele expression. We extracted DNA and RNA from frozen lung tissue and reverse‐transcribed cDNA from mRNA. We performed Sanger sequencing to assess allele‐specific expression by comparing the heights of variant nucleotide peaks in amplicons from genomic DNA and cDNA. We found similar genomic and cDNA variant nucleotide peak heights and no evidence of allele‐specific expression among explant or autopsy samples with biallelic missense ABCA3 variants (n = 6). We observed allele‐specific expression of missense alleles in trans with frameshift (n = 4) or nonsense (n = 1) variants, attributable to nonsense‐mediated decay.

However, to our knowledge, there is only one reported case of ABCA3 deficiency that significantly improved after AZM treatment. It is suggested that AZM is effective in treating chronic lung disease because it has various mechanisms of action, such as regulation of the production of inflammatory mediators and control of mucus hypersecretion. A recent study also showed that AZM promotes formation of lamellar bodies in bronchial epithelial cells. This action is probably due to drug-induced phospholipidosis, a side effect; however, this side effect could be beneficial in ABCA3 deficiency. The types of cases for which AZM will be effective and the clinical course of such treated cases remain unclear. In this case, although prednisolone and hydroxychloroquine were ineffective for first 4 months, the patient’s clinical symptoms dramatically improved and KL-6 concentration declined after 1 month of AZM treatment. Considering the change in KL-6 concentration and the patient’s clinical symptoms, we believe that AZM was significantly effective in this case. Moreover, no complications or side effects were observed. The early initiation of AZM treatment is important for ABCA3 deficiency because of its significant efficacy, albeit in some cases, and its long-term safety. Administration of AZM and hydroxychloroquine was approved by the ethical committee, and informed consent was obtained from the patient’s parents.

In some PFIC2 patients with missense mutations, BSEP is not detected at the canaliculus owing to mistrafficking of BSEP mutants. In vitro, chaperone drugs, such as 4‐phenylbutyrate (4‐PB), have been shown to partially correct mistrafficking. Four PFIC2 patients harboring at least one missense mutation (p.G982R, p.R1128C, and p.T1210P) were treated orally with 4‐PB and followed prospectively. Patient mutations were reproduced in a Bsep/green fluorescent protein plasmid. Cellular localization of the resulting Bsep mutants was studied in a hepatocellular line (Can 10), and effects of treatment with 4‐PB and/or ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) were assessed. In Can 10 cells, Bsep mutants were detected in the endoplasmic reticulum instead of at the canalicular membrane. Treatment with 4‐PB and UDCA partially corrected Bsep mutant targeting. With 4‐PB, we observed, in all patients, a decrease of pruritus and serum bile acid concentration (BAC) as well as an improvement of serum liver tests. Pathological liver injuries improved, and BSEP, which was not detected at the canalicular membrane before treatment, appeared at the canalicular membrane. Bile analyses showed an increase in BAC with 4‐PB. Patient conditions remained stable with a median follow‐up of 40 months (range, 3‐53), and treatment tolerance was good. Conclusion: 4‐PB therapy may be efficient in selected patients with PFIC2 owing to ABCB11 missense mutations affecting BSEP canalicular targeting. Bile secretion improvement may be a result of the ability of 4‐PB to retarget mutated BSEP. (Hepatology 2015) Hepatology 2015;62:558–566",10.1002/hep.27767

Mutations in the ABCB11 gene result in a deficiency of the bile salt export protein (BSEP) and accumulation of bile inside the hepatocytes. Hepatocellular carcinoma is another condition associated with severe forms of deletion mutations in the ABCB11 gene. Treatment options including ursodeoxycholic acid biliary diversion have mixed outcomes and some patients require liver transplantation. Here, we describe two siblings with an extremely mild form of PFIC2 inherited from heterozygous parents. The elder sibling had acute liver failure at the age of six months and both siblings had pruritus, cholestasis, coagulopathy and fat-soluble-vitamin deficiencies in infancy but have been asymptomatic past infancy. Genetic testing of the siblings revealed that each were compound heterozygotes for two missense mutations of the ABCB11 gene: p.C68Y and p.R832H. Medical treatment typical for PFIC2 has not been necessary for either patient. This is the first report of these variants following a mild course in two affected patients.",10.5604/01.3001.0009.8604

Methods: The clinical data of a 5-year-old child with cholestatic liver disease admitted to the Beijing Children's Hospital of Capital Medical University was retrospectively analyzed. The pathogenic variations were detected by whole exome sequencing and verified by Sanger sequencing, and bioinformatics was used to predict the pathogenicity of the mutation sites. Possible pathogenic variations were verified in vitro by Minigene assay. The clinical outcome was followed after discharge from hospital. Results: The 5-year-old boy had developed cholestasis at the age of 11 months. His physical examination showed obvious enlargement of the liver and spleen. Cholestatic cirrhosis was diagnosed by liver function tests, abdominal ultrasonography, liver biopsy and pathology. The results of genetic analysis showed that the patient was a complex heterozygote of the ABCB4 gene, with a pathogenic mutation c.2860G>A and a novel mutation c.2065-8T>G, derived from the mother and father respectively. The conservative prediction of the c.2065-8T>G site showed that this region was highly conserved and may affect splicing. Minigene assay results confirmed that the c.2065-8T>G mutation resulted in a 7 bp retention of intron 16 in the mature mRNA. In the absence of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, the amino acid frameshift forms a truncated protein, which is represented by p.Glu689ValfsTer19. The patient was diagnosed as progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 3 (PFIC3) and treated with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA). His clinical symptoms improved during 18 months of follow-up. Conclusions: The c.2065-8T>G variant is confirmed to affect the splicing process and exhibits complex heterozygosity with c.2860G>A, which is identified as the cause of the disease. PFIC3 children with this variant showed cholestatic liver disease as the main manifestation with a slow progression and was sensitive to treatment with UDCA.",10.3760/cma.j.cn112140-20240319-00190

 Progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC) is an uncommon disorder inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. PFIC type 3 (PFIC-3) results from mutations in the ABCB4 gene. This type typically advances from chronic cholestasis, which may occur with or without jaundice.
 
 
 
 A 16-year-old female presented with abdominal pain, later developing liver complications. Genetic testing revealed a novel ABCB4 gene mutation linked to cholestasis. Diagnosed with PFIC-3, she was treated with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) and vitamins, leading to improved liver function. Despite uncertain clinical significance of the mutation, predictions suggested it was damaging. Her liver function fully recovered, and she remained in remission during follow-up visits.
 
 
 
 PFIC3 is a rare, autosomal recessive disorder causing cholestasis and liver damage. Our study reported a young female with a novel ABCB4 mutation who responded well to UDCA. Diagnosis relies on comprehensive evaluation, and treatment options include UDCA, surgery, and liver transplantation.
 
 
 
 PFIC-3 gene must be considered while evaluating a young female with symptoms of cholestasis.

ABCB4,HGNC:45,progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 3,MONDO:0011214,A functional classification of ABCB4 variations causing progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 3,"Progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 3 is caused by biallelic variations of ABCB4, most often (≥70%) missense. In this study, we examined the effects of 12 missense variations identified in progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 3 patients. We classified these variations on the basis of the defects thus identified and explored potential rescue of trafficking‐defective mutants by pharmacological means. Variations were reproduced in the ABCB4 complementary DNA and the mutants, thus obtained, expressed in HepG2 and HEK293 cells. Three mutants were either fully (I541F and L556R) or largely (Q855L) retained in the endoplasmic reticulum, in an immature form. Rescue of the defect, i.e., increase in the mature form at the bile canaliculi, was obtained by cell treatments with cyclosporin A or C and, to a lesser extent, B, D, or H. Five mutations with little or no effect on ABCB4 expression at the bile canaliculi caused a decrease (F357L, T775M, and G954S) or almost absence (S346I and P726L) of phosphatidylcholine secretion. Two mutants (T424A and N510S) were normally processed and expressed at the bile canaliculi, but their stability was reduced. We found no defect of the T175A mutant or of R652G, previously described as a polymorphism. In patients, the most severe phenotypes appreciated by the duration of transplant‐free survival were caused by ABCB4 variants that were markedly retained in the endoplasmic reticulum and expressed in a homozygous status. Conclusion: ABCB4 variations can be classified as follows: nonsense variations (I) and, on the basis of current findings, missense variations that primarily affect the maturation (II), activity (III), or stability (IV) of the protein or have no detectable effect (V); this classification provides a strong basis for the development of genotype‐based therapies.

ABCB4,HGNC:45,progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 3,MONDO:0011214,Case Report: A rare case of young adult progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis-type 3 with a novel heterozygous pathogenic variant of ABCB4,"Progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 3 (PFIC-3) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder with poor prognosis. It is caused by pathogenic variants of the ATP binding cassette subfamily B member 4 (ABCB4) gene and usually progresses from chronic cholestasis with or without jaundice to portal hypertension and end-stage liver disease within the first to second decade of life. Few reported PFIC-3 patients presented with atypical clinical symptoms, therefore, often misdiagnosed if without family history. Herein, we report a 16-year-old male who was admitted to our hospital due to acute episodes of jaundice and intense pruritus, subsequently progressed to end-stage liver disease. Laboratory examinations showed no evidence of liver injury caused by viral, autoimmune, drug or liver tumors. Ursodeoxycholic acid and dexamethasone did not relieve his symptoms and he underwent liver transplantation successfully. Targeted next-generation sequencing identified that the patient was a compound heterozygote for two missense mutations (c.959C > T/c.1429C > A) in the ABCB4 gene. The mutation c.1429C > A (p.Q477K) is a novel heterozygous mutation. We constructed a three-dimensional model of this novel pathogenic variant using the SWISS MODEL program and found that the patient's ABCB4 protein is an ATP hydrolysis deficient mutant. The postoperative pathological diagnosis showed intrahepatic cholestasis with progression to cirrhosis. Negative liver tissue immunohistochemistry of MDR3 was found in the explanted liver. The patient was diagnosed with PFIC-3, and his symptoms improved dramatically with liver transplantation. In conclusion, for young patients with acute cholestasis, pruritus, jaundice, growth retardation, and enlargement of the liver and spleen, the possibility of inherited metabolic liver diseases should be considered, detailed medical and family history should be collected, and metabolic screening tests as well as gene tests are necessary for correct diagnosis. Increasing the coverage of PFIC3 is meaningful and thus can improve the current understanding of this disease.",10.3389/fped.2022.1012825

Clinical signs of intrahepatic cholestasis due to gene mutations typically first appear during infancy or childhood. Reports of PFIC3 occurring in adults are rare. CASE SUMMARY This is a case study of a 32-year-old infertile female Chinese patient with a 15-year history of recurrent abnormal liver function. Her primary clinical signs were elevated levels of alkaline phosphatase and γ-glutamyl transpeptidase. Other possible reasons for liver dysfunction were eliminated in this patient, resulting in a diagnosis of PFIC3. The diagnosis was confirmed using gene detection and histological analyses. Assessments using genetic sequencing analysis indicated the presence of two novel heterozygous mutations in the ABCB4 gene, namely, a 2950C>T; p.A984V mutation (exon 24) and a 667A>G; p.I223V mutation (exon 7). After receiving ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) treatment, the patient's liver function indices improved, and she successfully became pregnant by in vitro fertilization. However, the patient developed intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy in the first trimester. Fortunately, treatment with UDCA was safe and effective. CONCLUSION These novel ABCB4 heterozygous mutations have a variety of clinical phenotypes. Continued follow-up is essential for a comprehensive understanding of PFIC3.",10.12998/wjcc.v10.i6.1998

The main features of LPAC include a reduction or deficiency of phospholipids in bile, symptomatic cholelithiasis at <40 years of age, intrahepatic sludge and microlithiasis, mild chronic cholestasis, a high cholesterol/phospholipid ratio in bile, and recurrence of biliary symptoms after cholecystectomy. Needle-like cholesterol crystals, putatively “anhydrous” cholesterol crystallization at low phospholipid concentrations in model and native bile, are characterized in ABCB4 knockout mice, a unique animal model for LPAC. Gallbladder bile with only trace amounts of phospholipids in these mice is supersaturated with cholesterol, with lipid composition plotting in the left two-phase zone of the ternary phase diagram, consistent with “anhydrous” cholesterol crystallization. In this review, we summarize the molecular biology and physiological functions of ABCB4 and comprehensively discuss the latest advances in the genetic analysis of ABCB4 mutations and variations and their roles in the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of LPAC in humans, based on the results from clinical studies and mouse experiments. To date, approximately 158 distinct LPAC-causing ABCB4 mutations and variants in humans have been reported in the literature, indicating that it is a monogenic risk factor for LPAC. The elucidation of the ABCB4 function in the liver, the identification of ABCB4 mutations and variants in LPAC patients, and the exploration of gene therapy for ABCB4 deficiency in animal models can help us to better understand the cellular, molecular, and genetic mechanisms underlying the onset of the disease, and will pave the way for early diagnosis and prevention of susceptible subjects and effective intervention for LPAC in patients.",10.3390/genes13061047

Low phospholipid-associated cholelithiasis (LPAC) syndrome is a rare genetic form of intrahepatic cholesterol lithiasis, affecting mainly young adults. This review describes the recent advances in genetic and clinical characterization, diagnosis and management of LPAC syndrome.


RECENT FINDINGS
Recent publications report data from several retrospective cohorts. These cohorts describe the main clinical features, the most frequent radiological lesions, complications, the results of biliary endoscopic procedures and the prognosis associated with LPAC syndrome.


SUMMARY
LPAC syndrome has been linked to a partial defect in the ATP binding cassette subfamily B member 4 (ABCB4) gene encoding the canalicular phospholipid transporter multidrug resistance protein 3, but this mechanism would explain only half the cases, or even fewer. This syndrome is characterized by the appearance of cholelithiasis at an abnormally early age (before 40) and by the persistence of biliary symptoms after cholecystectomy. The diagnosis is usually confirmed by an ultrasound scan of the liver, which reveals the presence of intrahepatic microlithiasis, as evidenced by comet-tail images or microspots along the intrahepatic bile ducts. Ursodeoxycholic acid, at a daily dose of 5-15 mg/kg, is the reference treatment. If not performed prior to diagnosis, cholecystectomy should be avoided wherever possible. In complicated or refractory forms, endoscopic biliary intervention may be necessary.",10.1097/MOG.0000000000001077

The diagnosis of LPAC is defined by clinical as well as imaging criteria of intrahepatic hyperechoic foci or microlithiasis and biliary sludge on ultrasound. The aim of the study was to assess the role of imaging in investigating patients presenting with clinical features suggesting a diagnosis of LPAC. Methods Imaging findings in 51 patients with clinical LPAC were retrospectively reviewed. Most patients had been referred with difficult-to-manage biliary pain postcholecystectomy and some with intrahepatic dilated ducts and stones. The diagnosis of LPAC was made on clinical features. Results The patients were young with symptom onset at median age 24 years and were mainly female (75%). Ultrasound was performed by an expert in 48/51 and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) in 47/51 patients. Targeted liver ultrasound found small hyperechoic foci with comet tail artifacts or posterior acoustic shadowing typical of LPAC in 30/48 (63%) of examinations. However, ultrasound examinations performed before referral for investigation did not report these findings. Intrahepatic duct dilatation was seen in 26/51 (51%) of cases. MRCP did not reliably detect microlithiasis. Conclusions Targeted liver ultrasound performed by an expert aware of the possible diagnosis is the pivotal investigation for patients with clinical features suggesting LPAC.

The disease was initially described by Ichikawa and Hiraga in Germany in 1933. The prevalence of DUH is 0.3 per 100,000 with a female preponderance. The skin lesions usually appear in infancy or early childhood and cease to progress beyond adolescence. The subtypes DUH 1 and DUH 3 are found to have autosomal dominant inheritance, which is the most common inheritance pattern, while DUH 2 has an autosomal recessive pattern. The most common gene involved in DUH is ABCB6, while the other genes include SASH 1, PER 3, and KITLG (DUH type 2). DUH is characterized by multiple irregular hyperpigmented macules interspersed with hypopigmented macules in a mottled pattern over the trunk and extremities. The face is involved in 50% of individuals. Rarely, it can also involve hairs, nails, mucous membranes, palms, and soles. Other varied presentations include localized forms, localization of lesions to sun‐exposed areas, large macules, uniform palmar hypopigmentation, diffuse hyperpigmentation with spotty depigmented macules, and unilateral involvement. DUH has been reported to be associated with various cutaneous and systemic diseases. The authors have observed cases of DUH associated with hepatocellular carcinoma, solitary keratoacanthoma, and dermoid cyst.

In the previous study, the pathogenic genes of DUH have been identified in ATP-binding cassette subfamily B, member 6 and SASH1. However, the mutational screening of the causative gene remains incomplete and still lacks sufficient proof in the etiology. Patient concerns: A 2-generation Chinese family clinically diagnosed with DUH were enrolled. They showed pigmented spots from their childhood and came to the hospital for medical advice and genetic analysis. We found a novel mutation c.1757T > C (p.I586T) of SASH1 in 3 affected family members by whole-exome sequencing. Diagnoses: Genetic outcomes and clinical examinations confirmed the diagnosis of DUH in 3 family members with lentiginous syndrome. Interventions and outcomes: Using whole-exome sequencing and sanger sequencing technologies, we identified a novel mutation c.1757T > C (p.I586T) of SASH1 that co-segregated in 3 afflicted family members but not in the normal individuals. Significantly, c.1757T > C (p.I586T) is a novel mutation which had not been previously reported. The same codon position in SASH1 (c.1758C > G, p.I586M) has been reported in a Japanese man, and he showed identical phenotype compared to our study participants. Lessons: Our study broadens the spectrum of DUH mutations and provides more genetic characteristics of DUH in understanding its etiology.

Genetically, it shows heterogeneity, with at least two causative genes, ABCB6 and SASH1, reported. We present a familial case of DUH with autosomaldominant pigmentary disorder in a patient of Chinese Han ethnicity. The proband was a 23-year-old woman (Fig. 1a) who had been born with normal skin pigmentation. At the age of 12 years, hyperpigmented macules intermingled with pitting appeared on her mandibular area, and then gradually extended to involve her face, neck and upper chest with accentuation upon sun exposure (Fig. 1b,c). The lesions varied in shape and size, and some coalesced to form reticulated hyperpigmentation. No hyperkeratotic papules, hypopigmentation or palmar pits were noted, and the patient reported no photosensitivity. She was otherwise healthy. Affected family members showed similar phenotypes. Histological examination of a biopsy taken from the hyperpigmented macules on the patient’s neck revealed hyperkeratosis, elongation of rete ridges and thinning of the suprapapillary epidermis. Increased pigmentation of the basal layer, presence of pigment incontinence and mild dermal perivascular lymphocyte infiltration were also noted (Fig. 1d). Informed consent was obtained for genetic study to identify the underlying mutation in the proband. Wholeexome sequencing was performed and identified a novel heterozygous missense mutation c.2017A>G (p.Thr673Ala) in ABCB6, which was confirmed by Sanger sequencing (Fig. 2a). There were no mutations found in SASH1 or the causative genes for Dowling–Degos disease (DDD), xeroderma pigmentosum, dyschromatosis symmetrica hereditaria, or reticulate acropigmentation of Kitamura.

Methodology We performed genome-wide linkage scan using Illumina Human 660W-Quad BeadChip and exome sequencing analyses using Agilent SureSelect Human All Exon Kits in a multiplex Chinese DUH family to identify the pathogenic mutations and verified the candidate mutations using Sanger sequencing. Quantitative RT-PCR and Immunohistochemistry was performed to verify the expression of the pathogenic gene, Zebrafish was also used to confirm the functional role of ABCB6 in melanocytes and pigmentation. Results Genome-wide linkage (assuming autosomal dominant inheritance mode) and exome sequencing analyses identified ABCB6 as the disease candidate gene by discovering a coding mutation (c.1358C>T; p.Ala453Val) that co-segregates with the disease phenotype. Further mutation analysis of ABCB6 in four other DUH families and two sporadic cases by Sanger sequencing confirmed the mutation (c.1358C>T; p.Ala453Val) and discovered a second, co-segregating coding mutation (c.964A>C; p.Ser322Lys) in one of the four families. Both mutations were heterozygous in DUH patients and not present in the 1000 Genome Project and dbSNP database as well as 1,516 unrelated Chinese healthy controls. Expression analysis in human skin and mutagenesis interrogation in zebrafish confirmed the functional role of ABCB6 in melanocytes and pigmentation. Given the involvement of ABCB6 mutations in coloboma, we performed ophthalmological examination of the DUH carriers of ABCB6 mutations and found ocular abnormalities in them. Conclusion Our study has advanced our understanding of DUH pathogenesis and revealed the shared pathological mechanism between pigmentary DUH and ocular coloboma.",10.1371/journal.pone.0087250

SASH1 and ABCB6 have been identified as the causative genes for this disorder. We performed whole exome sequencing on a Chinese family with DUH and genotype-phenotype correlation analysis in DUH and lentiginous phenotype patients. A novel heterozygous missense mutation p.Q518P in SASH1 gene was detected in this family. A majority of patients with SASH1 mutations presented as a distinct clinical phenotype clearly different from that in patients with ABCB6 mutations.

ABCB6,HGNC:47,dyschromatosis universalis hereditaria 3,MONDO:0014169,Novel Mutations of ABCB6 Associated with Autosomal Dominant Dyschromatosis Universalis Hereditaria,"Objective Dyschromatosis universalis hereditaria (DUH) is a rare heterogeneous pigmentary genodermatosis, which was first described in 1933. The genetic cause has recently been discovered by the discovery of mutations in ABCB6. Here we investigated a Chinese family with typical features of autosomal dominant DUH and 3 unrelated patients with sporadic DUH. Methods Skin tissues were obtained from the proband, of this family and the 3 sporadic patients. Histopathological examination and immunohistochemical analysis of ABCB6 were performed. Peripheral blood DNA samples were obtained from 21 affected, 14 unaffected, 11 spouses in the family and the 3 sporadic patients. A genome-wide linkage scan for the family was carried out to localize the causative gene. Exome sequencing was performed from 3 affected and 1 unaffected in the family. Sanger sequencing of ABCB6 was further used to identify the causative gene for all samples obtained from available family members, the 3 sporadic patients and a panel of 455 ethnically-matched normal Chinese individuals. Results Histopathological analysis showed melanocytes in normal control’s skin tissue and the hyperpigmented area contained more melanized, mature melanosomes than those within the hypopigmented areas. Empty immature melanosomes were found in the hypopigmented melanocytes. Parametric multipoint linkage analysis produced a HLOD score of 4.68, with markers on chromosome 2q35-q37.2. A missense mutation (c.1663 C>A, p.Gln555Lys) in ABCB6 was identified in this family by exome and Sanger sequencing. The mutation perfectly cosegregated with the skin phenotype. An additional mutation (g.776 delC, c.459 delC) in ABCB6 was found in an unrelated sporadic patient. No mutation in ABCB6 was discovered in the other two sporadic patients. Neither of the two mutations was present in the 455 controls. Melanocytes showed positive immunoreactivity to ABCB6.

To assess fetal and neonatal eyes abnormalities and their progression during the last ZIKV outbreak and summarize learned lessons.


METHODS
A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted by a team of obstetricians and ophthalmologists.


RESULTS
Studies reporting ocular abnormalities during the prenatal (n = 5) and postnatal (n = 24) periods were included in the analysis. In the prenatal period, the most common ocular findings were intraocular calcification cases (4/6, 66.6%) and microphthalmia (3/6, 50%). Postnatal ocular abnormalities of congenital ZIKV infection were described after birth in 479 cases. Among them microphthalmia was reported in 13 cases (13/479, 2.7%). Posterior segment (retina and optic nerve) was the most affected structure, consisting of pigmentary changes (229/479, 47.8%), macular chorioretinal atrophy (216/479, 45%), optic nerve atrophy (181/479, 37.8%), increased cup-to-disk ratio (190/479, 39.6.%), optic nerve hypoplasia (93/479,19.4%), vascular changes (26/479, 5.4%), and retinal coloboma (20/479, 4.1%). The anterior segment was involved in 4.6% (22/479) of cases, including cataract (9/479, 1.8%), lens subluxation (1/479, 0.2%), iris coloboma (5/479, 1%), and congenital glaucoma (7/479, 1.4%). These ocular anomalies were isolated in one case (1/479, 0.2%) and multiple anomalies were found in the other cases. Long-term visual disorders have been described, with no possible improvement and even a worsening of some of the ocular anomalies previously observed. No reactivation of ocular lesions was observed.


CONCLUSION
This review highlights the severe ocular abnormalities associated with congenital ZIKV infections. The importance of multidisciplinary communication between the obstetrician, the maternal-fetal medicine specialist, and the ophthalmologist is emphasized.

ABCB6,HGNC:47,"microphthalmia, isolated, with coloboma 7",MONDO:0013783,OR16-04 OTX2 Mutations in Congenital Hypopituitarism Patients,"Abstract The transcription factor OTX2 is implicated in pituitary, ocular and craniofacial development. Mutations have been described in patients with variable congenital hypopituitarism (CH) ranging from isolated growth hormone deficiency (IGHD) to combined pituitary hormone deficiency (CPHD) with/without an ectopic posterior pituitary (EPP).We aimed (i) to establish the contribution of OTX2 mutations in the etiology of CH in a sub-cohort of patients and to study their functional consequences and (ii) establish a detailed human OTX2 expression profile in a hypothalamo-pituitary (HP) context. We screened 127 patients from national (n=103) and international centers (n=24) on the septo-optic dysplasia (SOD) spectrum with variable eye abnormalities. Eye abnormalities included micro/anophthalmia, retinal dystrophy and/or coloboma in 29 of these patients, with the rest having optic nerve hypoplasia (ONH). An EPP was reported on MRI in 35 patients. The cohort previously tested negative for mutations in HESX1, SOX2, SOX3, PROKR2 and GH1. Transactivation assays involved a dual-luciferase reporter in murine hypothalamic GT1-7 neurons transiently transfected with OTX2 constructs. In situ hybridization was performed to analyze human brain OTX2 expression during embryogenesis. Seven heterozygous OTX2 changes were identified: two chromosomal deletions spanning OTX2 in patients with micro/anophthalmia, GHD and an EPP, with one patient having cerebellar hypoplasia. Three missense substitutions resulting in truncated proteins: (i) the previously reported p.S138* and (ii) p.C170*, in two patients with retinal dystrophy, EPP and IGHD respectively, and (iii) the novel p.E79* in a patient with micro/anophthalmia, EPP and CPHD. A novel insertion-deletion resulting in a truncated protein p.S167* in a patient with microphthalmia, GHD, ONH, EPP and an enlarged abnormal pituitary, and a novel deletion resulting in a frameshift p.Val139Aspfs*39 in a patient with microcephaly, microphthalmia, ONH and an EPP were also identified. The human OTX2 variants caused a significant reduction in transactivation compared to wild type. Our gene expression data identified human OTX2 transcripts in the posterior pituitary, retina, ear, thalamus, choroid plexus, and in the hypothalamus during embryogenesis, but not in RP. To conclude, we identified OTX2 variants in 7 unrelated CH patients with eye abnormalities including 3 with retinal dystrophy and one with a cerebellar abnormality. As OTX2 is involved at multiple levels during HP development, these patients should be monitored for evolving endocrinopathies. Human OTX2 is expressed in the posterior pituitary, the retina and the ear at CS19 and 20 (between 6-7 weeks gestation), and in areas of the hindbrain at CS23, but not in RP at any stage analyzed in this study. The endocrine phenotypes in patients with OTX2 mutations are most likely of hypothalamic origin.",10.1210/jendso/bvaa046.1263
ABCB6,HGNC:47,"microphthalmia, isolated, with coloboma 7",MONDO:0013783,High-throughput genetic analysis in a cohort of patients with Ocular Developmental Anomalies,"Anophthalmia and microphthalmia (A/M) are developmental ocular malformations in which the eye fails to form or is smaller than normal with both genetic and environmental etiology. Microphthalmia is often associated with additional ocular anomalies, most commonly coloboma or cataract [1, 2]. A/M has a combined incidence between 1-3.2 cases per 10,000 live births in Caucasians [3, 4]. The spectrum of genetic abnormalities (chromosomal and molecular) associated with these ocular developmental defects are being investigated in the current study. A detailed pedigree analysis and ophthalmic examination have been documented for the enrolled patients followed by blood collection and DNA extraction. The strategies for genetic analysis included chromosomal analysis by conventional and array based (affymetrix cytoscan HD array) methods, targeted re-sequencing of the candidate genes and whole exome sequencing (WES) in Illumina HiSEQ 2500. WES was done in families excluded for mutations in candidate genes. Twenty four samples (Microphthalmia (M)-5, Anophthalmia (A)-7,Coloboma-2, M&A-1, microphthalmia and coloboma / other ocular features-9) were initially analyzed using conventional Geimsa Trypsin Geimsa banding of which 4 samples revealed gross chromosomal aberrations (deletions in 3q26.3-28, 11p13 (N=2) and 11q23 regions). Targeted re sequencing of candidate genes showed mutations in CHX10, PAX6, FOXE3, ABCB6 and SHH genes in 6 samples. High throughput array based chromosomal analysis revealed aberrations in 4 samples (17q21dup (n=2), 8p11del (n=2)). Overall, genetic alterations in known candidate genes are seen in 50% of the study subjects. Whole exome sequencing was performed in samples that were excluded for mutations in candidate genes and the results are discussed.",10.24870/CJB.2017-A79

ABCB7,HGNC:48,mitochondrial disease,MONDO:0044970,Characterization of Congenital Sideroblastic Anemia Model Due to ABCB7 Defects: How Do Defects in Iron-Sulfur Cluster Metabolism Lead to Ring Sideroblast Formation?,"Backgroun d: The sideroblastic anemias (SAs) are a group of congenital and acquired bone marrow disorderscharacterized by bone marrow ring sideroblasts (RSs). The disease commonly presents as myelodysplastic syndrome with RS (MDS-RS), known as an acquired clonal SA that is strongly correlated with a specific somatic mutation inSF3B1 (splicing factor 3b subunit 1), which is involved in RNA splicing machinery. Thus far, several studies have consistently revealed compromised splicing and/or expression of ABCB7 (ATP-binding cassette subfamily B member 7) in MDS-RS harboring the SF3B1 mutation. ABCB7 encodes an ATP-binding cassette family transporter localizing to the inner mitochondrial membrane, and its loss-of-function mutation causes a syndromic form of congenital SA, which is associated with cerebellar ataxia. The substrates transported by ABCB7 are predicted to be iron-sulfur clusters (ISCs), which are essential for the function of multiple mitochondrial and extramitochondrial proteins, such as ferrochelatase and aconitase (its apo-form without ISC is called IRP1; iron regulatory protein 1). However, the detailed molecular mechanisms by which defects in ISC metabolism resulting from ABCB7 defects contribute to RS formation remains to be fully elucidated.
 Methods: Endogenous ABCB7 was depleted based on pGIPZ lentiviral shRNAmir (Dharmacon) in human umbilical cord blood-derived erythroid progenitor (HUDEP)-2 cells (Kurita et al., PLoS ONE, 2013). Puromycin (Sigma) was used for the selection of transduced cells. To induce terminal erythroid differentiation, HUDEP-2 cells were co-cultured with OP9 stromal cells (ATCC) in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium supplemented with fetal bovine serum, erythropoietin, dexamethasone, monothioglycerol, insulin-transferrin-selenium, ascorbic acid, and sodium ferrous citrate (Saito and Fujiwara et al., MCB, 2019). For transcription profiling, Human Oligo Chip 25K (Toray) was used.
 Results: We first conducted ABCB7 knockdown in HUDEP-2 cells based on two independent shRNA plasmids. When the knockdown cells were induced to undergo erythroid differentiation,the majority of the erythroblasts exhibited aberrant mitochondrial iron deposition. Thus, we sought to clarify the potential causative link between ABCB7 defects and RS formation. Expression profiling revealed >1.5-fold up- and down-regulation of 33 and 44 genes, respectively, caused by the ABCB7 knockdown. Intriguingly, 43% of the downregulated gene ensemble (19/44 genes) included multiple ribosomal genes, such as RPS2, RPL11,and RPS12. The downregulated genes also included HMOX1 (heme oxygenase 1), implying that heme biosynthesis would be compromised by the knockdown. Gene ontology (GO) analysis revealed significant (p< 0.01) enrichment of genes associated with nuclear-transcribed mRNA catalytic process, cytoplasmic translation, and cellular iron ion homeostasis. Whereas the mRNA expression for ALAS2 (erythroid-specific 5-aminolevulinate synthase), encoding a rate-limiting enzyme of heme biosynthesis and one of the responsible genes for congenital SA, was not affected, its protein expression was noticeably decreased by ABCB7 knockdown, indicating that compromised transport of ISC from mitochondria to the cytosol may result in decreased ALAS2 translation by the binding of IRP1 to the iron-responsive element located in the 5'-UTR of ALAS2 mRNA.We are currently conducting detailed biological analyses to elucidate the causative link between defects in ISC metabolism due to ABCB7 defects and RS formation.
 Conclusion: We have first demonstrated the emergence of RS by ABCB7 depletion in human erythroblasts. Further characterization of the established SA model would aid in the clarification of its molecular etiology and the establishment of novel therapeutic strategies. Furthermore, our results may lead to a better understanding of the role of ISC in affecting cerebellar symptoms.

ABCB7,HGNC:48,mitochondrial disease,MONDO:0044970,Structures and functions of mitochondrial ABC transporters.,"A small number of physiologically important ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters are found in mitochondria. Most are half transporters of the B group forming homodimers and their topology suggests they function as exporters. The results of mutant studies point towards involvement in iron cofactor biosynthesis. In particular, ABC subfamily B member 7 (ABCB7) and its homologues in yeast and plants are required for iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster biosynthesis outside of the mitochondria, whereas ABCB10 is involved in haem biosynthesis. They also play a role in preventing oxidative stress. Mutations in ABCB6 and ABCB7 have been linked to human disease. Recent crystal structures of yeast Atm1 and human ABCB10 have been key to identifying substrate-binding sites and transport mechanisms. Combined with in vitro and in vivo studies, progress is being made to find the physiological substrates of the different mitochondrial ABC transporters.",10.1042/BST20150118

Mitochondria comprise up to four ABC systems, ABCB7/ATM1, ABCB10/MDL1, ABCB8 and ABCB6. These half-transporters, which assemble into homodimeric complexes, are involved in a number of key cellular processes, e.g. biogenesis of cytosolic iron–sulfur clusters, heme biosynthesis, iron homeostasis, multidrug resistance, and protection against oxidative stress. Here, we summarize recent advances and emerging themes in our understanding of how these ABC systems in the inner and outer mitochondrial membrane fulfill their functions in important (patho) physiological processes, including neurodegenerative and hematological disorders. ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporters belong to one of the most abundant families of integral membrane proteins found in all three kingdoms of life. Members of the ABC family play a major role in many cellular processes and mediate the active transport of a vast variety of solutes (e.g. amino acids, polysaccharides, peptides, lipids, drugs, antibiotics, toxins) across cellular membranes [1,2]. Although ABC proteins are represented in all organisms analyzed so far, their expression profiles and substrate specificities are highly diverse and differ in dependence of the specific cellular growth requirements and environmental influences. For instance, the genome of Agrobacterium tumefaciens encodes for 153 ABC proteins [3,4], while in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and human, 22 and 45 ABC transporters are present [5,6]. ABC transporters can be divided into two classes: i) ABC exporters that mediate e.g. the extrusion of toxic compounds (self-defense), and ii) ABC importers that primarily function as uptake systems for nutrients (metabolism). ABC importers typically recruit an extra substrate-binding protein that complexes the solute and hands it over to an outward-facing conformation of the ABC importer [7]. In eukaryotes, ABC transporters are located in the plasma membrane as well as in intracellular membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the Golgi apparatus, lysosomes, peroxisomes and mitochondria. Almost all eukaryotic ABC transporters function as exporters by translocating a wide range of unrelated substances across cell membranes …",N/A
ABCB7,HGNC:48,mitochondrial disease,MONDO:0044970,"Human Iron−Sulfur Cluster Assembly, Cellular Iron Homeostasis, and Disease†","Iron−sulfur (Fe−S) proteins contain prosthetic groups consisting of two or more iron atoms bridged by sulfur ligands, which facilitate multiple functions, including redox activity, enzymatic function, and maintenance of structural integrity. More than 20 proteins are involved in the biosynthesis of iron−sulfur clusters in eukaryotes. Defective Fe−S cluster synthesis not only affects activities of many iron−sulfur enzymes, such as aconitase and succinate dehydrogenase, but also alters the regulation of cellular iron homeostasis, causing both mitochondrial iron overload and cytosolic iron deficiency. In this work, we review human Fe−S cluster biogenesis and human diseases that are caused by defective Fe−S cluster biogenesis. Fe−S cluster biogenesis takes place essentially in every tissue of humans, and products of human disease genes, including frataxin, GLRX5, ISCU, and ABCB7, have important roles in the process. However, the human diseases, Friedreich ataxia, glutaredoxin 5-deficient sideroblastic anemia, ISCU myopathy, and ABCB7 sideroblastic anemia/ataxia syndrome, affect specific tissues, while sparing others. Here we discuss the phenotypes caused by mutations in these different disease genes, and we compare the underlying pathophysiology and discuss the possible explanations for tissue-specific pathology in these diseases caused by defective Fe−S cluster biogenesis.",10.1021/bi1004798
ABCB7,HGNC:48,mitochondrial disease,MONDO:0044970,Iron trafficking in the mitochondrion: novel pathways revealed by disease.,"It is well known that iron (Fe) is transported to the mitochondrion for heme synthesis. However, only recently has the importance of this organelle for many other facets of Fe metabolism become widely appreciated. Indeed, this was stimulated by the description of human disease states that implicate mitochondrial Fe metabolism. In particular, studies assessing various diseases leading to mitochondrial Fe loading have produced intriguing findings. For instance, the disease X-linked sideroblastic anemia with ataxia (XLSA/A) is due to a mutation in the ATP-binding cassette protein B7 (ABCB7) transporter that is thought to transfer [Fe-S] clusters from the mitochondrion to the cytoplasm. This and numerous other findings suggest the mitochondrion is a dynamo of Fe metabolism, being vital not only for heme synthesis but also for playing a critical role in the genesis of [Fe-S] clusters. Studies examining the disease Friedreich ataxia have suggested that a mutation in the gene encoding frataxin leads to mitochondrial Fe loading. Apart from these findings, the recently discovered mitochondrial ferritin that may store Fe in ring sideroblasts could also regulate the level of Fe needed for heme and [Fe-S] cluster synthesis. In this review, we suggest a model of mitochondrial Fe processing that may account for the pathology observed in these disease states.",10.1182/BLOOD-2004-10-3856
ABCB7,HGNC:48,mitochondrial disease,MONDO:0044970,Mitochondrial Iron Metabolism and Sideroblastic Anemia,"Sideroblastic anemias are a heterogeneous group of disorders, characterized by mitochondrial iron overload in developing red blood cells. The unifying characteristic of all sideroblastic anemias is the ring sideroblast, which is a pathological erythroid precursor containing excessive deposits of non-heme iron in mitochondria with perinuclear distribution creating a ring appearance. Sideroblastic anemias may be hereditary or acquired. Hereditary sideroblastic anemias are caused by defects in genes present on the X chromosome (mutations in the ALAS2, ABCB7, or GRLX5 gene), genes on autosomal chromosomes, or mitochondrial genes. Acquired sideroblastic anemias are either primary (refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts, RARS, representing one subtype of the myelodysplastic syndrome) or secondary due to some drugs, toxins, copper deficiency, or chronic neoplastic disease. The pathogenesis of mitochondrial iron loading in developing erythroblasts is diverse. Ring sideroblasts can develop as a result of a heme synthesis defect in erythroblasts (ALAS2 mutations), a defect in iron-sulfur cluster assembly, iron-sulfur protein precursor release from mitochondria (ABCB7 mutations), or by a defect in intracellular iron metabolism in erythroid cells (e.g. RARS).",10.1159/000243796
ABCB7,HGNC:48,mitochondrial disease,MONDO:0044970,Pathophysiology and genetic mutations in congenital sideroblastic anemia,"Sideroblastic anemias are heterogeneous congenital and acquired disorders characterized by anemia and the presence of ringed sideroblasts in the bone marrow. Congenital sideroblastic anemia (CSA) is a rare disease caused by mutations of genes involved in heme biosynthesis, iron–sulfur [Fe‐S] cluster biosynthesis, and mitochondrial protein synthesis. The most common form is X‐linked sideroblastic anemia, due to mutations in the erythroid‐specific δ‐aminolevulinate synthase (ALAS2), which is the first enzyme of the heme biosynthesis pathway in erythroid cells. Other known etiologies include mutations in the erythroid specific mitochondrial transporter (SLC25A38), adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding cassette B7 (ABCB7), glutaredoxin 5 (GLRX5), thiamine transporter SLC19A2, the RNA‐modifying enzyme pseudouridine synthase (PUS1), and mitochondrial tyrosyl‐tRNA synthase (YARS2), as well as mitochondrial DNA deletions. Due to its rarity, however, there have been few systematic pathophysiological and genetic investigations focusing on sideroblastic anemia. Therefore, a nationwide survey of sideroblastic anemia was conducted in Japan to investigate the epidemiology and pathogenesis of this disease. This review will cover the findings of this recent survey and summarize the current understanding of the pathophysiology and genetic mutations involved in CSA.",10.1111/ped.12217
ABCB7,HGNC:48,mitochondrial disease,MONDO:0044970,BIOL-06. MIR-1253 POTENTIATES CISPLATIN RESPONSE IN PEDIATRIC GROUP 3 MEDULLOBLASTOMA BY REGULATING FERROPTOSIS,"Abstract Medulloblastoma (MB), the most common malignant pediatric brain tumor and a leading cause of childhood mortality, is stratified into four primary subgroups, i.e. SHH (sonic hedgehog), WNT (wingless), and non-SHH/WNT groups 3 and 4, the latter representing high-risk MB. Haploinsufficiency of 17p13.3, which houses the tumor suppressor gene miR-1253, characterizes high-risk tumors. Despite improvements in targeted therapies, a limited proportion of these patients survive the disease. Capitalizing on the tumor suppressive properties of miRNAs as adjuncts to chemotherapy provides a promising alternative to current therapeutic strategies. In this study, we explored the potentiating effects of miR-1253 on cisplatin cytotoxicity in group 3 MB. First, in silico and in vitro analyses revealed an upregulation of ABCB7, a mitochondrial iron transporter and putative target of miR-1253, in MB cell lines and group 3 MB tumors. Overexpression of miR-1253 resulted in downregulation of ABCB7 and GPX4, a critical ferroptosis regulator, which consequently increased labile mitochondrial iron pool and, in turn, mitochondrial ROS (mtROS). Complementarily, we demonstrated, using CRISPR knockdown of ABCB7, ferroptosis induction with downregulation of GPx4 expression, liberation of free iron, mtROS generation and lipid peroxidation. Cisplatin is reported as an inducer of both apoptosis and ferroptosis-mediated cancer cell death. Therapeutically, the combination of miR-1253 and cisplatin led to an additive effect on cell viability, colony formation, apoptosis, and ROS generation. In turn, treatment with mtROS inhibitor (MnTBAP) and ferroptosis inhibitor (Ferrostatin) lead to partial recovery from the cytotoxic effects of this combination therapy. These studies identify an miR-1253-induced ferroptosis pathway targeting the ABCB7/GPX4/mtROS axis in group 3 MB. They further provide proof-of-concept in using miR-based therapeutics to augment treatment efficacy of current chemotherapeutics in the treatment of high-risk tumors.",10.1093/neuonc/noab090.013

ABCC4,HGNC:55,qualitative platelet defect,MONDO:0001197,Utility of thromboelastography with platelet mapping (TEG-PM) for monitoring platelet transfusion in qualitative platelet disorders,"Patients with pathogenic variants in RASGRP2 (inherited platelet disorder (IPD)-18) have normal platelet counts but show impaired platelet aggregation due to diminished activation of αIIbβ3 integrin. This defect results in moderate to severe bleeding episodes, especially following surgical procedures, which require patients to be transfused with platelets and/or pro-hemostatic agents. We recently demonstrated that the hemostatic efficacy of transfused platelets is limited by dysfunctional endogenous platelets in a mouse model of IPD-18 (Rasgrp2-/- mice), as dysfunctional platelets were recruited to the forming hemostatic plug but did not participate in clot contraction. Consequently, higher amounts of transfused platelets were required to outcompete these dysfunctional cells and to reverse bleeding. We here studied the usefulness of thromboelastography with platelet mapping (TEG-PM), a method to evaluate platelet-dependent clot contraction, for ex vivo monitoring of the hemostatic potential in Rasgrp2-/- mice transfused with various amounts of wild-type (WT) platelets. Rasgrp2-/- whole blood samples did not contract in TEG-PM, consistent with a critical role of this protein in αIIbβ3 activation. Addition of WT platelets improved TEG parameters (K time, α-angle, MA) in a ratio dependent manner, consistent with our recent in vivo studies showing impaired hemostasis at a 5:1, but not at a 2:1 ratio of mutant to WT platelets. Interestingly, K and α values were identified as better predictors of transfusion efficacy than MA, the most platelet-dependent TEG parameter. In conclusion, this proof-of-concept study supports the use of TEG-PM to monitor platelet transfusion ratios and hemostatic potential in IPD-18 and potentially other platelet disorders.",10.1101/2024.05.09.593198

Evaluate quantitative and qualitative outputs when comparing the incidence of platelet concentrates (PCs) combined with autogenous bone grafts to an autograft control group for the reconstruction of alveolar cleft defects.


DESIGN
Systematic review and meta-analysis.


PATIENTS/PARTICIPANTS
Randomized and nonrandomized controlled clinical trials where PCs were used in the reconstruction of alveolar cleft defects.


INTERVENTIONS
Use of PCs in combination with autogenous bone graft in the experimental group and autogenous bone graft alone in the control group.


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S)
Average bone formation and bone density were evaluated, mean differences were calculated and pooled by a meta-analysis technique. Additionally, clinical outcomes such as wound dehiscence, closure of the oronasal fistula, pain, swelling, discharges, infections, and bleeding were considered in the qualitative synthesis.


RESULTS
After an evaluation of forty-nine articles, nineteen were considered for the review. The qualitative assessment of bone density, bone formation, and clinical outcomes showed no differences between groups in most of the included studies. The meta-analysis showed no statistical differences between PCs groups when compared to the control group in bone density at three months (mean difference 45.67 HU, P = .23) and six months (mean difference 48.57 HU, P = .64). Neither were statistical differences in the percentage of regenerated bone volume at six months (mean difference 6.39%, P = .15) and the volume of newly formed bone at 12 months (mean difference 0.37 mm3, P = .99).


CONCLUSIONS
There were no significant differences in terms of bone formation, bone density, and clinical outputs between groups.",10.1177/10556656231222076

ABCC8,HGNC:59,monogenic diabetes,MONDO:0015967,Monogenic Diabetes due to ABCC8/KCNJ11 Mutation: Case Study and Review of Literature,"Monogenic diabetes arises due to mutation in a single-gene and is recognized by their striking familial inheritance pattern. This form of diabetes is inherited in an autosomal dominant or recessive fashion, unlike polygenic Type 1 (autoimmune) or type 2 diabetes caused by the combined action of more than one gene [1-11]. Monogenic diabetes is classified into three main groups: Neonatal diabetes mostly presents in the first six months of birth, maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY) and maternally inherited mitochondrial diabetes.

These mutations run in the family and have a predictable course. Most of the monogenic diabetes is treated with oral medications like sulfonylurea rather than insulin. ABCC8/KCNJ11 gene mutations also cause monogenic diabetes. This gene mutation has been found in ~50% of congenital hyperinsulinemia (CHI) patients. In such cases diabetes commonly presents in the neonatal period (transient or permanent) or at adolescence / early adulthood [1]. 

We present a 58-year-old diabetic lady, who was detected with ABCC8 mutation during the cascade testing [8]. She was diagnosed with diabetes at the age of 12 [8]. Her son had history of neonatal hypoglycaemia and developed diabetes at the age of 15. He was the index case who was found to have ABCC8 mutation. The family has several other members diagnosed with diabetes. The aim of the article is to increase awareness and understanding of monogenic diabetes among the medical practitioners in adult population with diabetes so that the genetic testing can be offered in a cost effective manner.",10.37191/MAPSCI-2582-7960-1(1)-006
ABCC8,HGNC:59,monogenic diabetes,MONDO:0015967,[Clinical characteristics and genetic analysis of children and adolescents with monogenic diabetes].,"OBJECTIVE
To explore the clinical characteristics and molecular basis for children and adolescents with monogenic diabetes.


METHODS
A retrospective analysis was carried out for the clinical manifestations and laboratory data of 116 children and adolescents diagnosed with diabetes at Ningbo Women and Children's Hospital from January 2020 to March 2023. Whole exome sequencing and mitochondrial gene sequencing were carried out on 21 children with suspected monogenic diabetes.


RESULTS
A total of 10 cases of monogenic diabetes were diagnosed, all of which were Maturity-onset Diabetes Of the Young (MODY). Six cases of MODY2 were due to GCK gene mutations, 1 case of MODY3 was due to HNF1A gene mutation, 2 cases of MODY12 were due to ABCC8 gene mutations, and 1 case of MODY13 was due to KCNJ11 gene mutation. Nine of the 10 patients with MODY had no typical symptoms of diabetes. A family history of diabetes was significantly more common in the MODY group compared with the T1DM and T2DM groups (P < 0.05). The BMI of the MODY group was higher than that of the T1DM group (P < 0.05). The initial blood glucose level was lower than that of the T1DM group (P < 0.05), and there was no significant difference compared with the T2DM group. The fasting C-peptide level of the MODY group was higher than that of the T1DM group (P < 0.05), and there was no significant difference compared with the T2DM group. Glycosylated hemoglobin of the MODY group was lower than both the T1DM and T2DM groups (P < 0.05).


CONCLUSION
In this study, MODY has accounted for the majority of monogenic diabetes among children and adolescents, and the common mutations were those of the GCK gene in association with MODY2. Blood glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin of children with MODY were slightly increased, whilst the islet cell function had remained, and the clinical manifestations and laboratory tests had overlapped with those of type 2 diabetes. WES and mitochondrial gene sequencing can clarify the etiology of monogenic diabetes and facilitate precise treatment.",10.3760/cma.j.cn511734-20230515-00844
ABCC8,HGNC:59,monogenic diabetes,MONDO:0015967,Phenotypic variability in two siblings with monogenic diabetes due to the same ABCC8 gene mutation,"ABCC8 gene mutations with different inheritance patterns have been well described to cause transient and permanent forms of neonatal diabetes with onset of hyperglycemia commonly before the age of 6 months, and rare cases between 6 and 12 months. However, recent analyses have also demonstrated ABCC8 gene mutations in patients with monogenic diabetes (maturity onset diabetes of the young, MODY), with milder clinical phenotypes and later onset of hyperglycemia. We report two siblings with diabetes mellitus due to a novel homozygous p.(Phe1068Ile) (c.3202T>A) missense mutation of the ABCC8 gene, but significantly different phenotypes. The index case was diagnosed with diabetes due to an incidental finding of hyperglycemia at the age of 3 years, while her younger sibling presented with severe hyperglycemia and hyperosmolar dehydration at the age of 10 weeks. The possibility of a significant discordance in the correlation between genotype and phenotype needs to be taken into account when ABCC8 mutation dependent diabetes occurs within the same family. Genetic screening in children with diabetes from consanguineous family needs consideration, especially in case of negative autoantibodies and early onset of hyperglycemia.",10.1111/pedi.12826

We identified pathogenic mutations in monogenic diabetes genes in a prospective cohort of Chinese with young-onset diabetes, and compared the clinical characteristics and outcome between patients with and those without mutations.
 Methods: From patients enrolled in the Hong Kong Diabetes Register between 1995-2012, DNA samples of 1021 Chinese with non-type 1 diabetes diagnosed ≤40 years old were sequenced. The custom targeted panel included 34 genes related to neonatal diabetes, maturity-onset diabetes of the young, syndromes associated with diabetes and severe insulin resistance. Variants were interpreted according to standard guidelines by ACMG. Patients were followed for incident complications until 2019.
 Results: Pathogenic or likely pathogenic mutations in monogenic diabetes genes were detected in 33 (3.2%) patients. Mutations were more common in HNF1A (n=7) , GCK (n=6) and ABCC8 (n=5) genes. Mutation carriers had a higher female ratio (72.7 vs. 54.6%, p=0.05) and lower age at enrollment (37.9±10.6 vs. 41.5±10.4 years, p=0.05) but were similar age at diagnosis (31.5±7.3 vs. 33.1±6.0 years, p=0.13) and in diabetes duration (5.0[1.0-11.0] vs. 6.0[1.0-13.0] years, p=0.29) at baseline compared to non-carriers. Mutation carriers had lower BMI (23.6±3.5 vs. 26.0±4.8 kg/m2, p<0.01) , systolic blood pressure (119.4±14.9 vs. 125.6±17.4 mmHg, p=0.05) , HbA1c (7.3±1.3 vs. 7.9±2.0%, p=0.01) and triglyceride level (1.01[0.66-1.53] vs. 1.38[0.90-2.17] mmol/L, p=0.01) . Over a median follow-up of 17.1 years, (30.3%) patients with mutation vs. 369 (37.3%) without mutations developed cardiovascular disease, chronic or end-stage kidney disease and/or died (p=0.47) .
 Conclusion: Around 3% of Chinese with young-onset non-type 1 diabetes had mutation in monogenic diabetes genes. Despite a more favorable metabolic profile, patients with mutation had similar incidence of diabetes complications to those without mutations.

It encompasses a broad spectrum of heterogeneous conditions, including neonatal diabetes, maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY) and syndromic diabetes, affecting 1–5% of patients with diabetes. Some of these variants are harbored by genes whose altered function can be tackled by specific actions (“actionable genes”). In suspected patients, molecular diagnosis allows the implementation of effective approaches of precision medicine so as to allow individual interventions aimed to prevent, mitigate or delay clinical outcomes. This review will almost exclusively concentrate on the clinical strategy that can be specifically pursued in carriers of mutations in “actionable genes”, including ABCC8, KCNJ11, GCK, HNF1A, HNF4A, HNF1B, PPARG, GATA4 and GATA6. For each of them we will provide a short background on what is known about gene function and dysfunction. Then, we will discuss how the identification of their mutations in individuals with this form of diabetes, can be used in daily clinical practice to implement specific monitoring and treatments.

In this review, we describe the genotype-histotype-phenotype correlations in HH and their therapeutic implications. CHI can occur from birth or later on in life. Histologically, diffuse CHI shows diffuse beta cell hypertrophy with a few giant nuclei per islet of Langerhans, most frequently caused by loss-of-function mutations in ABCC8 or KCNJ11. Focal CHI is histologically characterized by focal adenomatous hyperplasia consisting of confluent hyperplastic islets, caused by a paternal ABCC8/KCNJ11 mutation combined with paternal uniparental disomy of 11p15. CHI in Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is caused by mosaic changes in the imprinting region 11p15.4-11p15.5, leading to segmental or diffuse overgrowth of endocrine tissue in the pancreas. Morphological mosaicism of pancreatic islets is characterized by occurence of hyperplastic (type 1) islets in one or a few lobules and small (type 2) islets in the entire pancreas. Other rare genetic causes of CHI show less characteristic or unspecific histology. HH with a predominant adult onset includes insulinomas, which are pancreatic insulin-producing endocrine neoplasms, in some cases with metastatic potential. Insulinomas occur sporadically or as part of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 due to MEN1 mutations. MAFA mutations may histologically lead to insulinomatosis with insulin-producing neuroendocrine microadenomas or neuroendocrine neoplasms. NI-PHHS is mainly seen in adults and shows slight histological changes in some patients, which have been defined as major and minor criteria. The genetic cause is unknown in most cases.

In the first patient, who presented persistent severe hypoglycemia since the first day of life, molecular genetic testing revealed the presence of a homozygous mutation in the ABCC8 gene [deletion in the ABCC8 gene c.(2390+1_2391-1)_(3329+1_3330-1)del] that correlated with a diffuse form of hyperinsulinism (the parents being healthy heterozygous carriers). In the second patient, the onset was on the third day of life with severe hypoglycemia, and genetic testing identified a heterozygous mutation in the ABCC8 gene c.1792C>T (p.Arg598*) inherited on the paternal line, which led to the diagnosis of the focal form of hyperinsulinism. To locate the focal lesions, (18)F-DOPA (3,4-dihydroxy-6-[18F]fluoro-L-phenylalanine) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) was recommended (an investigation that cannot be carried out in the country), but the parents refused to carry out the investigation abroad. In this case, early surgical treatment could have been curative. In addition, the second child also presented secondary adrenal insufficiency requiring replacement therapy. At the same time, she developed early recurrent seizures that required antiepileptic treatment. We emphasize the importance of molecular genetic testing for diagnosis, management and genetic counseling in patients with HH.",10.3390/ijms25105533

There is no consensus on the gold-standard imaging method to diagnose focal insulin-producing lesions beyond infancy. A 14-year-old boy with a complex medical history and refractory epilepsy, presented with blood glucose (BG) of 52 mg/dL (2.9 mmol/L) (normal reference range: 70-100 mg/dL [3.9-5.6 mmol/L]) and increased seizure frequency. He failed a fast within 4 hours, with BG of 48 mg/dL (2.7 mmol/L) and insulin level of 4.6 µIU/mL (24.6 pmol/L) (diagnostic at the time of hypoglycemia >1.25 μU/mL [8.7 pmol/L]). Conventional imaging studies showed no pancreatic lesion. Fluorine-18-L-dihydroxyphenylalanine positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (18F-DOPA-PET/MRI) scan premedicated with carbidopa demonstrated intense focal 18F-DOPA uptake in the distal pancreatic tail. He underwent distal pancreatectomy. Histopathology showed focal pancreatic islet cell hyperplasia, with more than 90% of the neuroendocrine islet cells being positive for chromogranin and synaptophysin, with no loss of p57 staining. Genetic studies were negative for mutations in ABCC8, KCNJ11, GCK, or GLUD1 genes, multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type 1, and Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome. BG normalized after surgery. Seizure frequency improved. This case highlights the utility of 18F-DOPA PET/MRI imaging in diagnosing focal hyperinsulinism beyond infancy.",10.1210/jcemcr/luae153

The pancreatic KATP channel is composed of a pore-forming inwardly-rectifying potassium channel, Kir6.2, and a regulatory subunit, sulphonylurea receptor 1 (SUR1). Loss-of-function mutations in either subunit often lead to the development of persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of infancy (PHHI). PHHI is a rare genetic disease and most patients present with immediate onset within the first few days after birth. In this study, we report an unusual form of PHHI, in which the index patient developed hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia after 1 year of age. The patient failed to respond to routine medication for PHHI and underwent a complete pancreatectomy. Genotyping of the index patient and his immediate family members showed that the patient and other family members with hypoglycemic episodes carried a heterozygous novel mutation in KCNJ11 (C83T), which encodes Kir6.2 (A28V). Electrophysiological and cell biological experiments revealed that A28V hKir6.2 is a dominant-negative, loss-of-function mutation and that KATP channels carrying this mutation failed to reach the cell surface. De novo protein structure prediction indicated that this A28V mutation reoriented the ER retention motif located at the C-terminal of the hKir6.2, and this result may explain the trafficking defect caused by this point mutation. Our study is the first report of a novel form of late-onset PHHI that is caused by a dominant mutation in KCNJ11 and exhibits a defect in proper surface expression of Kir6.2.",10.1080/19336950.2017.1393131

We aimed to assess the role of 18F-DOPA PET/CT in such patients at our institution. Materials and methods In this prospective study, 18F-DOPA PET/CT scans and clinical details of 20 children with clinical diagnosis of hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia were reviewed. Scans were acquired at 5 min postinjection of 2-3 mCi of 18F-DOPA on dedicated PET/CT scanners (Biograph mCT, Siemens Inc and Discovery PET/CT, GE). Abdominal spot images over 1–2 bed positions were acquired. Additionally, genetic mutation status, where available, was correlated to the scan findings. Results Out of 20 children (7 female and 13 male), 13 were infants. The age of the children ranged from 3 months to 8 years. Fifteen children had undergone gene analysis, 12 were positive for mutation in ABCC8, 1 for GLUD-1, 1 for GCK mutations and 1 had not shown any mutation. 18F-DOPA PET/CT scan showed 5 focal pancreatic lesions in 5 children (1 in each), two focal lesions in 1 child and diffuse pancreatic uptake in 14 children. Conclusion 18F-DOPA PET/CT is a useful modality for localizing focal pancreatic lesions in children with persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia. The detection rate is significantly higher in patients with ABCC8 paternal monoallelic recessive gene mutation. 18F-DOPA PET/CT scan consequent to findings on genetic analysis appears to be useful in planning the management of children with hyperinsulinism.",10.1097/MNM.0000000000001526

Methods: The clinical data of 123 patients who were diagnosed with hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia by comprehensive clinical diagnostic procedures in the Department of Pediatric Endocrinology and Inherited Metabolic Diseases, Children's Hospital of Fudan University between January 2016 and December 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. Clinical data such as gender, age of onset, province, concurrent serum insulin level measured during hypoglycemia, lesion type of pancreas by 18F-DOPA-PET CT scanning, genetic test results, and treatment were collected successively. The clinical features and therapeutic outcomes were compared between patients with focal and diffuse pancreatic lesions. T test, Rank sum test, and χ² test were used for comparison between groups. Results: A total of 123 patients with hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia (72 males and 51 females), whose average age of onset was 3 days (ranging from 1 day to 4 860 days), were recruited from 24 provinces. The concurrent serum insulin level was 7.1 (0.4-303.0) mU/L during hypoglycemia. 18F-DOPA-PET CT scanning identified focal lesions in 25.2% (31/123) and diffuse lesions in 74.8% (92/123) of the patients; 64.2% (79/123) of the HH cases were found to have pathogenic gene variants, in which 88.6% (70/79) were found to have KATP channel related genes (61 in ABCC8 and 9 in KCNJ11 mutations). Thirty-seven patients (17 focal and 20 diffuse) received surgical treatment with a success rate of 67.6% (25/37). The effective rate of diazoxide for children with diffuse type was significantly higher than that of children with focal group (28.3% (26/92) vs. 9.7% (3/31), χ²=10.31, P=0.001). Conclusions: 18F-DOPA-PET CT scan can improve the success rate of surgery.

ABCC9 codes for the SUR2A subunit of the cardiac K(ATP) channel. Missense mutations are implicated in the development of Cantu as gain of function effects, but a null mutation has been reported in the literature as causing isolated DCM. We report a large family with an ABCC9 mutation. The female proband presented at age 63 with severe bradycardia requiring a pacemaker, and was diagnosed at age 67 with DCM. A heterozygous null mutation in ABCC9, c.169C >T (p. Gln57X) in exon 2 was discovered and was reported in 2009 as presumed pathogenic. Her obligate carrier brother had severe DCM in his mid 50’s requiring cardiac transplantation. Her obligate carrier sister is reported to have a pacemaker in her 60’s with no DCM. In the subsequent generation, a male with the mutation at age 46 had a normal LV size and function, with a reported mild concentric LVH. Four other mutation carriers (ages 32, 40, 42 and 59) have no echocardiographic evidence of DCM. Although non-penetrance and variable expressivity could explain the large number of unaffected mutation carriers in the family, it remains unclear if this ABCC9 mutation is responsible for the DCM in this family. Despite mutations in this gene being reported in 2004 as causing DCM, there are few subsequent reports of affected families, and no reports of familial segregation. This family illustrates the difficulty in interpreting molecular results when literature is limited and published before more stringent criteria for pathogenicity were established. The importance of careful family follow up of purported genetic mutations cannot be overstated. A critical literature review and correlating familial genotype and phenotype information should be performed when interpreting molecular genetic test results.",10.1136/jmedgenet-2015-103577.28

Manchester Terrier dogs offer a naturally occurring model of SCDY, with sudden death of puppies as the manifestation of an inherited dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). We performed a genome-wide association study for SCDY/DCM in Manchester Terrier dogs and identified a susceptibility locus harboring the cardiac ATP-sensitive potassium channel gene ABCC9. Sanger sequencing revealed an ABCC9 p.R1186Q variant present in a homozygous state in all SCDY/DCM-affected dogs (n = 26). None of the controls genotyped (n = 398) were homozygous for the variant, but 69 were heterozygous carriers, consistent with autosomal recessive inheritance with complete penetrance (p = 4 × 10−42 for the association of homozygosity for ABCC9 p.R1186Q with SCDY/DCM). This variant exists at low frequency in human populations (rs776973456) with clinical significance previously deemed uncertain.

Methods Sixty-six unrelated Chinese patients (mean age 49.1±17.0 years; 71% male) diagnosed with SDCM were enrolled. The clinical history and genomic DNA of the cohort were collected and examined. The exons of 24 genes closely associated with familial DCM (ABCC9, ACTC1, ACTN2, DES, LAMA4, LDB3, LMNA, MYBPC3, MYH6, MYH7, MYPN, PLN, PSEN1, PSEN2, RBM20, SCN5A, SGCD, TAZ, TCAP, TMPO, TNNI3, TNNT2, TPM1, and VCL) were sequenced using targeted next-generation sequencing method. All called nonsynonymous variants and their occurrence frequencies were compared against population data from public databases. And the nonsynonymous variants were also evaluated for pathogenicity by PolyPhen 2 (PP2) and Sorts Intolerant From Tolerant (SIFT) algorithms. Results Eighty-five nonsynonymous variants were detected in 17 genes. The variants and their occurrence frequencies in the patients were compared against population data from the 1000 Genomes and NHLBI (National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute) Go Exome Sequencing Project. Forty-nine nonsynonymous variants had occurrence frequencies that were significantly higher in the study patients than in the general population, indicating that they have the potential to increase the risk of DCM. The risk variants were distributed in 40 (61%) patients, among whom 25 carried a single variant, while the remaining patients carried multiple (2 to 4) variants. Risk variants occurred more frequently in MYBPC3 (14% of the patients), SCN5A (14%), MYH7 (12%), MYPN (9%), and LDB3 (8%), as verified by Poisson distribution analysis, which were considered “the five risky genes”. Conclusions We found that genetic variants with potential risk for DCM were commonly present in SDCM patients, indicating that genetic factors contribute to the pathogenesis, and (probably) the onset, of DCM in these patients.",10.21037/atm-21-6774

Genetic studies in familial DCM have found mutations identified in more than 30 genes. However, the genetics of sporadic DCM is still unknown.

Objective: To provide new insights into the pathophysiology of sporadic DCM, a mutational screening on 30 DCM-causing genes in a cohort was performed.

Methods and Results: Patients diagnosed with idiopathic DCM were recruited into the study and underwent clinical evaluation. Genomic DNA was isolated from the peripheral blood and then 30 genes ( ACTC, DES, SGCD, MYH7, TNNT2, TPM1, TTN, VCL, MYBPC3, CSRP3, ACTN2, PLN, LDB3, MYH6, ABCC9, TNNC1, TCAP, TNNI3, EYA4, TMPO, PSEN1/2, CRYAB, PDLIM3, MYPN, LAMA4, ILK, ANKRD1, RBM20, LMNA , and SCN5A ) of every sample were detected by next-generation sequencing. All called variants were compared against National Center for Biotechnology Information SNP Database build 137 and the March 2012 release of the 1000 Genomes project. All variants identified in the cohort were compared in ethnic-matched controls consisting of 197 adult Chinese from the 1000 Genomes. The pathogenicity of the variants absent from controls were evaluated by SIFT software. Sixty-six adult Chinese unrelated DCM patients were tested for up to 30 genes causing familial DCM. The mean age was 49.14±15.97 years. Every patient was detected nonsynonymous variants, and the total 87 variants were composed of 39 novel and 48 known. Among the whole 87 variants, 34 satisfied the criteria (1) absent from ethnic-matched controls and (2) altering evolutionary conservation of amino acid verified by SIFT analysis, which were considered pathogenic mutations, identified in 30 patients accounting for 45.45% of the cohort. The 2 most frequent genes involved in mutation positive patients were SCN5A (12.12%) and MYH7 (10.61%).

Conclusions: Mutant genes found in familial DCM were also common in sporadic DCM, and the discovery of novel mutations spanned the spectrum of DCM genetics, implicating that genetic etiologies play an important role in pathogenesis of sporadic DCM.",N/A

ABCD1,HGNC:61,adrenoleukodystrophy,MONDO:0018544,Genetic analysis of the X-linked Adrenoleukodystrophy ABCD1 gene in Drosophila uncovers a role in Peroxisomal dynamics,"X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder caused by a loss-of-function (LOF) mutation in the ATP-binding cassette subfamily D member 1 (ABCD1) gene, leading to the accumulation of very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs). This disorder exhibits striking heterogeneity; some male patients develop an early childhood neuroinflammatory demyelination disorder, while other patients, including adult males and most affected female carriers, experience a chronic progressive myelopathy. Adrenocortical failure is observed in almost all male patients, with age of onset varying sometimes being the first diagnostic finding. The gene underlying this spectrum of disease encodes an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter that localizes to peroxisomes and facilitates VLCFA transport. X-ALD is considered a single peroxisomal component defect and does not play a direct role in peroxisome assembly. Drosophila models of other peroxisomal genes have provided mechanistic insight into some of the neurodegenerative mechanisms with reduced lifespan, retinal degeneration, and VLCFA accumulation. Here, we perform a genetic analysis of the fly ABCD1 ortholog Abcd1 (CG2316). Knockdown or deficiency of Abcd1 leads to VLCFA accumulation, salivary gland defects, locomotor impairment and retinal lipid abnormalities. Interestingly, there is also evidence of reduced peroxisomal numbers. Flies overexpressing the human cDNA for ABCD1 display a wing crumpling phenotype characteristic of the pex2 loss-of-function. Surprisingly, overexpression of human ABCD1 appears to inhibit or overwhelm peroxisomal biogenesis to levels similar to null mutations in fly pex2, pex16 and pex3. Drosophila Abcd1 is therefore implicated in peroxisomal number, and overexpression of the human ABCD1 gene acts a potent inhibitor of peroxisomal biogenesis in flies.",10.1101/2024.09.23.614586

We report two distinct single nucleotide deletions in the ABCD1 gene, c.253delC [p.Arg85Glyfs*18] in exon 1, leading to both cerebral ALD and to AMN phenotype in one family, and c.1275delA [p.Phe426Leufs*15] in exon 4, leading to AMN and primary adrenal insufficiency in a second family. For the latter variant, we demonstrate reduced mRNA expression and a complete absence of the ABCD1 protein in PBMC.

X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) is caused by mutations in ABCD1, a peroxisomal gene. More than half of males with an ABCD1 mutation develop inflammatory cerebral demyelination (cALD), but underlying mechanisms remain unknown and therapies are limited. We sought to develop and characterize a mouse model of cALD to facilitate study of disease mechanisms and therapy development.


METHODS
We used immunoassays and immunohistochemistry to assess novel (interleukin 18 [IL-18]) and established molecular markers in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and postmortem brain tissue from cALD patients. We generated a cALD phenotype in Abcd1-knockout mice using a 2-hit method that combines cuprizone and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis models. We then used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and immunohistochemistry to assess the fidelity of cALD molecular markers in the mice.


RESULTS
Human and mouse cALD lesions shared histologic features of myelin phagocytosis, myelin loss, abundant microglial activation, T and B-cell infiltration, and astrogliosis. Compared to wild-type controls, Abcd1-knockout mice displayed more cerebral demyelination, blood-brain barrier disruption, and perivascular immune cell infiltration. This enhanced inflammatory response was associated with higher levels of fibrin deposition, oxidative stress, demyelination, and axonal injury. IL-18 immunoreactivity co-localized with perivascular monocytes/macrophages in both human and mouse brain tissue. In cALD patients, CSF IL-18 levels correlated with MRI lesion severity.


INTERPRETATION
Our results suggest loss of Abcd1 function in mice predisposes to more severe blood-brain barrier disruption, cerebral inflammation driven by the infiltration of peripheral immune cells, demyelination, and axonal damage, replicating human cALD features. This novel mouse model could shed light on cALD mechanisms and accelerate cALD therapy development. ANN NEUROL 2024.",10.1002/ana.27117
ABCD1,HGNC:61,X-linked cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy,MONDO:0010247,Two Single Nucleotide Deletions in the ABCD1 Gene Causing Distinct Phenotypes of X-Linked Adrenoleukodystrophy,"X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) is a rare inborn error of the peroxisomal metabolism caused by pathologic variants in the ATP-binding cassette transporter type D, member 1 (ABCD1) gene located on the X-chromosome. ABCD1 protein, also known as adrenoleukodystrophy protein, is responsible for transport of the very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA) from cytoplasm into the peroxisomes. Therefore, altered function or lack of the ABCD1 protein leads to accumulation of VLCFA in various tissues and blood plasma leading to either rapidly progressive leukodystrophy (cerebral ALD), progressive adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN), or isolated primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison’s disease). We report two distinct single nucleotide deletions in the ABCD1 gene, c.253delC [p.Arg85Glyfs*18] in exon 1, leading to both cerebral ALD and to AMN phenotype in one family, and c.1275delA [p.Phe426Leufs*15] in exon 4, leading to AMN and primary adrenal insufficiency in a second family. For the latter variant, we demonstrate reduced mRNA expression and a complete absence of the ABCD1 protein in PBMC. Distinct mRNA and protein expression in the index patient and heterozygous carriers does not associate with VLCFA concentration in plasma, which is in line with the absence of genotype–phenotype correlation in X-ALD.",10.3390/ijms24065957

The search for biomarkers which correlate to CALD disease burden and respond to intervention has long been sought after. We used the Olink Proximity Extension Assay (Uppsala, Sweden) to explore the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) of young males with CALD followed by correlative analysis with plasma. Using the Target 96 Neuro Exploratory panel, we found that, of the five proteins significantly increased in CSF, only neurofilament light chain (NfL) showed a significant correlation between CSF and plasma levels. Young males with CALD had a 11.3-fold increase in plasma NfL compared with controls. Importantly, 9 of 11 young males with CALD who underwent HCT showed a mean decrease in plasma NfL of 50% at 1 year after HCT compared with pre-HCT levels. In conclusion, plasma NfL could be a great value in determining outcomes in CALD and should be scrutinized in future studies in patients prior to CALD development and after therapeutic intervention.",10.3390/cells11050913
ABCD1,HGNC:61,X-linked cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy,MONDO:0010247,Identification of Two Novel Mutations of ABCD1 Gene in Pedigrees with X-Linked Adrenoleukodystrophy and Review of the Literature,"Background X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) is an inherited peroxisomal metabolism disorder, resulting from the loss-of-function mutation of ATP-binding cassette protein subfamily D1 (ABCD1) gene. The dysfunction of ALD protein, a peroxisomal ATP-binding cassette transporter, results in the excessive saturated very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) accumulation in organs including the brain, spine, and adrenal cortex. X-ALD is characterized as the childhood, adolescent, adult cerebral ALD, adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN), adrenal insufficiency, and asymptomatic phenotypes, exhibiting a high variety of clinical neurological manifestations with or without adrenocortical insufficiency. Results In this study, we reported two cases of X-ALD, which were first diagnosed as adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease) and treated with adrenocortical supplement. However, both of the cases progressed as neurological symptoms and signs after decades. Elevated VLCFAs level, brain MRI scan, and genetic analysis confirmed final diagnosis. In addition, we identified two novel mutations of ABCD1 gene, NM_000033.3 (ABCD1): c.874_876delGAG (p.Glu292del) and NM_000033.3 (ABCD1): c.96_97delCT (p.Tyr33Profs∗161), in exon 1 of ABCD1 gene. Sanger sequencing confirmed that the proband's mother of the first case was heterozygous carrying the same variant. Adrenal insufficiency-only type is very rare; however, it may be the starting performance of X-ALD. In addition, we summarized reported mutation sites and clinical manifestations to investigate the correlationship of phenotype-genotype of X-ALD. Conclusions The early warning manifestations should be noticed, and the probability of X-ALD should be considered. This report could be beneficial for the early diagnosis and genetic counseling for patients with X-ALD.",10.1155/2022/5479781

It is caused by defects in the ATP-binding cassette subfamily D member 1 (ABCD1) gene, resulting in impaired peroxisomal β-oxidation of very-long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs). As an X-linked recessive disease, female X-ALD carriers are typically asymptomatic. In the present study, a 7-year-old girl was diagnosed with cerebral ALD. Brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed asymmetric demyelination of bilateral white matter. Plasma VLCFAs level showed a substantial increase. Whole exome and Sanger sequencing revealed an ABCD1 c.919C>T (p.Q307X) heterozygous pathogenic mutation, which was inherited from the asymptomatic mother. X chromosome inactivation (XCI) analysis revealed that the normal paternal X chromosome was almost completely inactivated. Thus, the maternal ABCD1 mutation and paternal XCI were responsible for causing the disease in the patient. XCI may be one reason female X-ALD carriers can be symptomatic.",10.3892/etm.2022.11502

ABCD1,HGNC:61,adrenomyeloneuropathy,MONDO:0015339,A novel ABCD1 gene mutation causes adrenomyeloneuropathy presenting with spastic paraplegia: A case report,"Rationale: X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) is caused by mutations in the ABCD1 gene leading to very long chain fatty acid (VLCFA) accumulation. The disease demonstrates a spectrum of phenotypes including adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN). We aimed to identify the genetic basis of disease in a patient presenting with AMN features in order to confirm the diagnosis, expand genetic knowledge of ABCD1 mutations, and elucidate potential genotype-phenotype associations to inform management. Patient concerns: A 29-year-old male presented with a 4-year history of progressive spastic paraplegia, weakness of lower limbs, fecal incontinence, sexual dysfunction, hyperreflexia, and positive Babinski and Chaddock signs. Diagnoses: Neuroimaging revealed brain white matter changes and spinal cord thinning. Significantly elevated levels of hexacosanoic acid (C26:0) and tetracosanoic acid (C24:0) suggested very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA) metabolism disruption. Genetic testing identified a novel hemizygous ABCD1 mutation c.249dupC (p.F83fs). These findings confirmed a diagnosis of X-linked ALD with an AMN phenotype. Interventions: The patient received dietary counseling to limit VLCFA intake. Monitoring for adrenal insufficiency and consideration of Lorenzo’s oil were advised. Genetic counseling and testing were offered to at-risk relatives. Outcomes: At present, the patient continues to experience progressive paraplegia. Adrenal function remains normal thus far without steroid replacement. Family members have undergone predictive testing. Lessons: This case expands the known mutation spectrum of ABCD1-linked X-ALD, providing insight into potential genotype-phenotype correlations. A thoughtful diagnostic approach integrating clinical, biochemical and genetic data facilitated diagnosis. Findings enabled genetic counseling for at-risk relatives regarding this X-linked disorder.",10.1097/MD.0000000000037874

A pathogenic splice-site variant of ABCD1 (c.1489-1G>A, p.Val497Alafs*51) and elevated levels of very long-chain fatty acids were found, leading to the diagnosis of AMN.

Mutations in the ABCD1 gene have been identified to cause AMN. Methods We applied clinical evaluation, laboratory tests, and neuroimaging on three patients with progressive spastic paraparesis. In genetic analysis, we investigated ABCD1 gene mutations by whole-exome sequencing and Sanger sequencing. Bioinformatics tools were used to predict the effects of identified ABCD1 mutations on the protein. Results All three patients were men with adult-onset disease, mainly characterized by progressive spastic paraparesis. Among them, two patients had peripheral neuropathy and one patient had signs of adrenal insufficiency. All three patients showed cerebral involvement on brain MRI, while two patients were found with diffuse cord atrophy on spinal MRI. High-VLCFA levels in plasma, as well as C24:0/C22:0 and C26:0/C22:0 ratios, were found in all three patients. In addition, three different ABCD1 mutations were identified in three unrelated Chinese families, including one known mutation (c.1415_1416delAG) and two novel mutations (c.217C>T and c.160_170delACGCAGGAGGC). Based on the clinical assessment, radiographic, biochemical, and genetic testing, the final diagnosis was AMN in these patients with spastic paraparesis. Conclusion This study reported three patients with AMN and identified two novel mutations in the ABCD1 in the Chinese population. Our finding emphasized that X-ALD is an important cause of adult-onset spastic paraplegia. Thus, neuroimaging, VLCFA testing, and especially the detection of the ABCD1 gene have important implications for the etiological diagnosis of adult patients with spastic paraplegia.",10.3389/fneur.2023.1126729

ABCD1,HGNC:61,adrenomyeloneuropathy,MONDO:0015339,Novel ABCD1 Gene Mutation in Adrenomyeloneuropathy with Hypoplasia and Agenesis of the Corpus Callosum,"Background: Adult adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN) is caused by mutations in the ABCD1 gene. Some pure AMN patients develop cerebral demyelination late in life. However, hypoplasia and agenesis of the corpus callosum (CC) has never been reported in AMN patients. Objective: To describe a new clinical variant of AMN that is possibly caused by a novel ABCD1 gene mutation. Methods: A total of 10 members in an X-linked inherited family were examined. The age at onset, progression of disability, and clinical manifestations were collected. Blood tests of the index case were conducted in an academic hospital. Cerebral and spinal MRI was performed in 4 affected members using a Siemens 3.0-T or Hitachi 1.0-T MR scanner. Whole-exome sequencing was conducted in the index case, which was subsequently validated by Sanger sequencing in the family. Results: The patients displayed typical degenerative spastic paraparesis and peripheral sensorimotor neuropathy with some intrafamilial variations. In addition to neurological deficits, all male patients displayed alopecia since adolescence. Furthermore, an increase in plasma long-chain fatty acids was observed. Based on these presentations, adult AMN was diagnosed for the patients. Intriguingly, cerebral MRI showed multiple types of hypoplasia and agenesis of the CC including anterior remnant CC agenesis, truncated corpus and splenium, anterior remnant CC agenesis along with thin corpus and splenium. Whole-exome sequencing revealed a nonsense mutation (c.231G>A) which results in a truncated protein product (p.W77X) that might be nonfunctional. No other mutations associated with alopecia or hypoplasia and agenesis of the CC were identified in the exome-sequencing database. Conclusion: In addition to the typical symptoms such as spastic myelopathy, cognitive impairment, mixed neuropathy, and alopecia, AMN patients can also display hypoplasia and agenesis of the CC, which was not described in the other AMN patients reported before.",10.1159/000490248

ABCD1,HGNC:61,isolated adrenal insufficiency,MONDO:0100315,ABCD1 and X‐linked adrenoleukodystrophy: A disease with a markedly variable phenotype showing conserved neurobiology in animal models,"X‐linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X‐ALD) is a phenotypically heterogeneous disorder involving defective peroxisomal β‐oxidation of very long‐chain fatty acids (VLCFAs), due to mutation in the ABCD1 gene. X‐ALD is the most common peroxisomal inborn error of metabolism and confers a high degree of morbidity and mortality. Remarkably, a subset of patients exhibit a cerebral form with inflammatory invasion of the central nervous system and extensive demyelination, while in others only dying‐back axonopathy or even isolated adrenal insufficiency is seen, without genotype–phenotype correlation. X‐ALD's biochemical signature is marked elevation of VLCFAs in blood, a finding that has been utilized for massive newborn screening for early diagnosis. Investigational gene therapy approaches hold promises for improved outcomes. However, the pathophysiological mechanisms of the disease remain poorly understood, limiting investigation of targeted therapeutic options. Animal models for the disease recapitulate the biochemical signature of VLCFA accumulation and demonstrate mitochondrially generated reactive oxygen species, oxidative damage, increased glial death, and axonal damage. Most strikingly, however, cerebral invasion of leukocytes and demyelination were not observed in any animal model for X‐ALD, reflecting upon pathological processes that are yet to be discovered. This review summarizes the current disease models in animals, the lessons learned from these models, and the gaps that remained to be filled in order to assist in therapeutic investigations for ALD.",10.1002/jnr.24953

It leads to adrenal insufficiency (AI) and axonal demyelination. In males, the phenotype varies from isolated adrenocortical insufficiency and progressive myelopathy to cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy (CALD). The aim of this case series is to characterize patients with different clinical presentations of X-ALD with follow-up at a tertiary Portuguese hospital. All four patients were males, and the median age at the diagnosis was 5 years. Three patients were diagnosed through family screening, with the oldest already displaying hyperpigmentation. Two distinct forms were identified: adolescent CALD (25%) and isolated primary adrenal insufficiency (75%). Analytical studies revealed elevated plasma VLCFA levels in all cases, and genetic analysis demonstrated two different mutations in the ABCD1 gene. This disorder requires early diagnosis for improved prognosis. Screening male children with primary AIfor X-ALD using a VLCFA panel should be considered, particularly after ruling out the most common causes or when learning difficulties are evident.

ABCD1,HGNC:61,isolated adrenal insufficiency,MONDO:0100315,Family Perspectives on Newborn Screening for X-Linked Adrenoleukodystrophy in California,"X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) is caused by gene variants in the ABCD1 gene, resulting in a varied clinical spectrum. Males with ALD present with symptoms ranging from isolated adrenal insufficiency and slowly progressive myelopathy to severe cerebral demyelination. Females who are heterozygous for ALD typically develop milder symptoms by late adulthood. Treatment for adrenal insufficiency associated with ALD exists in the form of cortisol, and cerebral ALD may be treated with stem cell transplantation. Currently, there is no treatment for myelopathy. Since 2013, at least 14 states have added ALD to their newborn screening (NBS) panel, including California in 2016. We examined the impact of a positive NBS result for ALD on families in California. Qualitative interviews were conducted with mothers of 10 children who were identified via NBS for ALD. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed using thematic analysis by two coders. Mothers felt strongly that ALD should be included on California’s NBS panel; however, many expressed concerns over their experience. Themes included stress at initial phone call, difficulty living with uncertainty, concerns regarding mental health support, and desire for more information on disease progression, treatments and clinical trials. Mothers exhibited diverse coping strategies, including relying on faith, information seeking, and maintaining hope. Mothers’ recommendations for healthcare providers included: educating providers making the initial phone call, providing patient-friendly resources, offering information about ongoing research, and streamlining care coordination. Advice for parents of children with ALD focused on staying hopeful and appreciating the time they have with their children. As more states add ALD to their NBS panel, it is important to improve the current model to promote family resiliency and autonomy.",10.3390/ijns5040042
ABCD1,HGNC:61,isolated adrenal insufficiency,MONDO:0100315,Movement Disorders in Women with X-Linked Adrenoleukodystrophy (1608),"Objective: To describe the movement disorders seen among women with X-linked Adrenoleukodystrophy Background: X-linked Adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) is a peroxisomal disorder caused by mutations in the ABCD1 gene which codes for the transporter of very long chain fatty acids. The clinical spectrum in males with ALD ranges from isolated adrenal insufficiency and slowly progressive myelopathy to devastating cerebral demyelination. As ALD is an X-linked disease, women were previously thought to be asymptomatic carriers. More recently it has been recognized that up to 80% of women with ALD experience some degree of myelopathy. These symptoms, while progressive in nature, are thought to a milder form of the myelopathy seen in men with ALD. Design/Methods: We did a systematic survey of X-ALD clinic patients seen from 2013–2018 at Massachusetts General Hospital. An estimate of 15% in retrospective review has myelopathy and concurrent movement disorders. Detailed medical and family history were obtained. Blood samples were collected for X-inactivation studies. Standardized videotaped neurological examination was performed and subsequently reviewed by two different movement disorder specialists. Results: Careful evaluation showed a combination of different movements such as cervical dystonia (4), spasmodic adductor dysphonia (3), action and postural tremor (6), bradykinesia (1) and ataxia (8). All patients exhibited gait difficulties and symptoms of myelopathy. Conclusions: Movement disorders may be a feature of many hereditary neurodegenerative and metabolic disorders especially among women affected by X-linked disorders. In most of these cases, dystonia and tremor usually occur in the setting of a broader clinical phenotype. Interestingly, movement disorders are not known to be associated with the slowly progressive myelopathy in men with ALD. Hence this finding represents a first distinct phenotype in women with ALD. The notion that ALD may be an underdiagnosed cause of movement disorder among women with ALD warrants further investigation. Disclosure: Dr. Supnet has nothing to disclose.

We present isolated bilateral adrenal metastases successfully treated with 177Lu-PSMA in a 66-year-old man diagnosed with castration-resistant prostate cancer. The patient had progression under chemotherapy as depicted by 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT showing intense bilateral PSMA uptake in the adrenal masses, and metastasis-directed therapies were considered as the first option for improving survival because the patient was oligometastatic. However, surgery and radiotherapy were not justifiable options due to the high risk of definitive adrenal insufficiency; therefore, the patient received 4 cycles of 177Lu-PSMA treatment. 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT showed near-complete response in bilateral adrenal metastases, and no sign of adrenal insufficiency was observed during follow-up.",10.1097/RLU.0000000000004964
ABCD1,HGNC:61,isolated adrenal insufficiency,MONDO:0100315,Delayed Emergence of Isolated Secondary Adrenal Insufficiency: A Case Report,"Secondary adrenal insufficiency (SAI) is a rare condition caused by adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) deficiency, which disrupts ACTH secretion by the pituitary gland and can lead to chronic hyponatremia. However, idiopathic delayed onset of isolated adrenal insufficiency without triggering factors is an unusual finding and poses a challenging diagnosis. We present the case of an 80-year-old woman with hypothyroidism, hypertension, previous tobacco use, and squamous cell carcinoma of the ankle who presented with weakness and fatigue. Blood work showed hyponatremia (126 mmol/L), nonfasting blood glucose of 139 mg/dL, and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR, 83 mm/hr). Initial treatment included urea administration and water restriction. Initial imagining included a CT of the chest which revealed mediastinal lymphadenopathy, leading to suspicion of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) from malignancy. Despite increasing urea and adding NaHCO3, sodium levels dropped further. Tolvaptan was administered but showed no improvement. Endocrinology recommended hydrocortisone sodium succinate (Solu-Cortef) leading to sodium normalization and symptom resolution. A full pituitary workup revealed low dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S), and abdominal CT showed atrophic adrenal glands. MRI of the sella turcica was normal with no evidence of a mass. The patient was discharged on an oral course of Solu-Cortef with stable sodium levels (139 mEq/L). This is among the first reported cases of unprovoked isolated adrenal insufficiency with abnormal cortisol, ACTH, DHEA-S levels, and normal renin and aldosterone levels. Diagnosis is often delayed due to nonspecific symptoms. Once identified, corticosteroid replacement therapy is the gold standard for management.",10.7759/cureus.71209

This study aims to explore the efficacy of Tribulus terrestris fruit extract (TTFE) and an isolated compound (hecogenin) on metyrapone-induced AI. Adrenal glands manage processes such as metabolism, blood pressure, and stress response by generating hormones from their two main components, the cortex and medulla. The adrenal cortex generates glucocorticoids (GC) and mineralocorticoids, while the medulla produces adrenaline and noradrenaline. Reduced production of GC, mineralocorticoids, and adrenal androgens as a result of the adrenal gland’s destruction or lack of stimulation is the hallmark of AI. Primary, secondary, and tertiary forms of AI are prevalent conditions with various etiologies. If left untreated, they lead to an adrenal crisis. Synthetic GC (prednisolone and hydrocortisone) and mineralocorticoids (fludrocortisone) are the only drugs that help treat AI. The Wistar rats were selected for the study and treated with T. terrestris extract and an isolated compound (hecogenin) in the presence of metyrapone. Behavioral and hormonal assessments were performed. Corticosterone, aldosterone, sodium, and potassium were measured. The findings showed that exposure to metyrapone showed a drastic reduction of cortisol, aldosterone, and locomotor scores. Additionally, metyrapone decreased locomotor score and serum cortisol. However, treatment with Tribulus extract and hecogenin showed a significant rise in the levels of aldosterone, corticosterone, sodium, and potassium. 400 and 800 mg/kg of TTFE and hecogenin 50 mg/kg showed significant increases in the levels of corticosterone, aldosterone, sodium, and potassium levels in Wistar rats.",10.1177/09731296241299495

ABCD3,HGNC:67,congenital bile acid synthesis defect 5,MONDO:0014564,Peroxisomal ABC Transporters: An Update,"ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters constitute one of the largest superfamilies of conserved proteins from bacteria to mammals. In humans, three members of this family are expressed in the peroxisomal membrane and belong to the subfamily D: ABCD1 (ALDP), ABCD2 (ALDRP), and ABCD3 (PMP70). These half-transporters must dimerize to form a functional transporter, but they are thought to exist primarily as tetramers. They possess overlapping but specific substrate specificity, allowing the transport of various lipids into the peroxisomal matrix. The defects of ABCD1 and ABCD3 are responsible for two genetic disorders called X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy and congenital bile acid synthesis defect 5, respectively. In addition to their role in peroxisome metabolism, it has recently been proposed that peroxisomal ABC transporters participate in cell signaling and cell control, particularly in cancer. This review presents an overview of the knowledge on the structure, function, and mechanisms involving these proteins and their link to pathologies. We summarize the different in vitro and in vivo models existing across the species to study peroxisomal ABC transporters and the consequences of their defects. Finally, an overview of the known and possible interactome involving these proteins, which reveal putative and unexpected new functions, is shown and discussed.",10.3390/ijms22116093
ABCD3,HGNC:67,congenital bile acid synthesis defect 5,MONDO:0014564,Substrate Specificity and the Direction of Transport in the ABC Transporters ABCD1-3 and ABCD4.,"The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters are one of the largest families of membrane-bound proteins and exist in almost all living organisms from eubacteria to mammals. They transport diverse substrates across membranes utilizing the energy of ATP hydrolysis as a driving force and play an essential role in cellular homeostasis. In humans, four ABC transporters classified as subfamily D have been identified. ABCD1-3 are localized to peroxisomal membranes and involved in the transport of various acyl-CoAs from the cytosol to the peroxisomal lumen. ABCD4 functions on the lysosomal membranes and transports vitamin B12 (cobalamin) from lysosomes into the cytosol. The mutation of genes encoding ABCD1, ABCD3, and ABCD4 are responsible for genetic diseases called X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy, congenital bile acid synthesis defect 5, and cobalamin deficiency, respectively. In this review, we summarize the targeting mechanism and physiological functions of the ABCD transporters and discuss insights that have been obtained on the transport mechanism based on disease-causing mutations and cryo-electron microscopy (EM) structural studies.",10.1248/cpb.c21-01021
ABCD3,HGNC:67,congenital bile acid synthesis defect 5,MONDO:0014564,Clinical and genetic features of congenital bile acid synthesis defect with a novel mutation in AKR1D1 gene sequencing,"Abstract Rationale: Congenital bile acid synthesis defect (BASD) is a rare disease caused by mutations in the aldo-keto reductase 1D1 gene, which encodes the primary Δ4-3-oxosteroid 5β-reductase enzyme. Early disease diagnosis is critical for early treatment with bile acid replacement therapy, with an excellent chance for recovery. In contrast, protracted diagnosis and treatment may lead to poor outcomes, including decompensated hepatic cirrhosis, liver transplant, and even death. Patient concerns: Three clinical congenital bile acid synthesis defect cases in the Vietnamese population are herein reported. These pediatric patients presented with symptoms of prolonged postpartum jaundice and abnormal loose stool (mucus, lipids, and white). The clinical examinations showed hepatosplenomegaly. Urinalysis showed a very low fraction of primary bile acids and atypical 3-oxo-Δ4- bile acids in all three patients. Diagnoses: The patients were diagnosed with primary Δ4-3-oxosteroid 5β-reductase deficiency. Next-generation gene sequencing revealed two homozygous mutations in the aldo-keto reductase family 1 member D1 gene. The first is a documented variant, c.797G>A (p.Arg266Gln), and the second is a novel mutation at c.155T>C (p.Ile52Thr). Interventions: Immediately after diagnosis, patients were treated with oral chenodeoxycholate 5 mg/kg/d. Outcomes: The patients’ symptoms, signs, and primary bile acids levels improved significantly. Lessons: Clinicians should consider genetic disorders related to cholestasis for effective and life-saving treatment. A prompt genetic analysis by next-generation gene sequencing enables patients to access bile acid replacement therapy earlier, significantly improving short- and long-term outcomes.",10.1097/MD.0000000000029476

This paper reported the clinical and genetic features of a CBAS2 patient definitely diagnosed by AKR1D1 genetic analysis. An 8-month-old male infant was referred to the hospital with the complaint of jaundiced skin and sclera over 7 months. On physical examination, growth retardation and malnutrition were discovered besides mild jaundice of the skin and sclera. The liver was palpable 8 cm below the right subcostal margin with medium texture, and the spleen was not enlarged. On liver function test, elevated levels of bilirubin (predominantly conjugated bilirubin) and transaminases were detected, but serum total bile acids and γ-glutamyl transpeptidase levels were within the normal ranges. Liver histopathologic analysis showed disorganized bile ducts, obvious multinucleated giant cells, significant cholestasis in hepatocytes, together with portal and interstitial fibrosis and lymphocytic infiltration.

Sitosterolemia is a rare genetic disorder directly associated with dysfunction of ABCG5 and G8 genes. The data obtained was used to analyze the cellular mechanisms and the role of transporters in absorption and excretion of serum sterols. Thus, to understand the influence of mutations on the development of cardiovascular disease. Aim. To investigate the clinical manifestation between sitosterolemia and familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), focusing on how dysfunctions of transporters lead to the misdiagnosis of sitosterolemia as FH. Research Strategy.The data collection was conducted by searching research papers in English based on lipidology. The search strategy identified 118 papers, of which 42 were selected that meet established inclusion criteria: full-text publications in English, meta-analyses, cohort studies, experiments on mice, whereas established exclusion criteria: research papers in other languages, promotional articles, conferences, short reports. The research papers reviewed the span from 1970 to 2022. Results. Inactivation of genes causes the dysregulation of sterols. FH is characterized by elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), whereas sitosterolemia presents with moderate elevation in LDL-C but dramatic increase in phytosterols. The phenotypic overlap between sitosterolemia and FH complicates detection. Both disorders manifest cardiovascular complications with elevated total cholesterol (TC) levels. The lipid profile distinguishes these conditions, necessitating HPLC, GC-MS tools. Genetic testing for mutations is essential for confirmation. The findings suggest that sitosterolemia mimics the FH state. FH is managed primarily with statins, while sitosterolemia requires ezetimibe. In addition, dietary modifications that reduce the intake of plant sterols are recommended. Conclusion. This review highlights ABCG5 and ABCG8 mutations that impair sterol transport, causing plant sterol accumulation. The condition often leads to xanthomas and early coronary artery disease. A major diagnostic challenge is the overlap with FH, as similar lipid abnormalities can obscure proper diagnosis.
 Введение. Ситостеролемия - это редкое генетическое заболевание, непосредственно связанное с дисфункцией генов ABCG5 и ABCG8. Полученные данные использовались для анализа клеточных механизмов и роли транспортёров в абсорбции и выведении стеролов из организма. Таким образом, целью исследования является понимание влияния мутаций на развитие сердечно-сосудистых заболеваний. Цель. Изучить клинические проявления ситостеролемии и семейной гиперхолестеринемии (СГ), с акцентом на то, как дисфункции транспортёров приводят к ошибочной диагнозу ситостеролемии как СГ. Стратегия поиска. Сбор данных осуществлялся путём поиска научных статей на английском языке, посвящённых липидологии. В ходе поиска было выявлено 118 публикаций, из которых 42 статьи соответствовали установленным критериям включения: полнотекстовые публикации на английском языке, метаанализы, исследования пациентов, эксперименты на мышах. Исключались статьи на других языках, рекламные материалы, материалы конференций и краткие отчёты. Обзор охватывал исследования, опубликованные в период с 1970 по 2022 годы. Результаты. Инактивация генов приводит к дисрегуляции транспорта стеролов. Для СГ характерно повышение уровня липопротеинов низкой плотности (ЛПНП), в то время как ситостеролемия сопровождается умеренным увеличением ЛПНП, но значительным повышением уровня фитостеролов. Фенотипическое сходство между ситостеролемией и СГ затрудняет их диагностику. Оба заболевания сопровождаются сердечно-сосудистыми осложнениями и повышением общего холестерина (ОХ). Липидный профиль позволяет различать эти состояния, для чего требуются такие методы, как ВЭЖХ и ГХ-МС. Генетическое тестирование на наличие мутаций является необходимым для подтверждения диагноза. Полученные данные показывают, что ситостеролемия имитирует состояние, схожее с СГ. Основной метод лечения СГ — использование статинов, тогда как для ситостеролемии требуется назначение эзетимиба. Кроме того, рекомендуется изменение рациона с ограничением потребления растительных стеролов. Вывод. Обзор подчеркивает, что мутации в генах ABCG5 и ABCG8, нарушающие транспорт стеролов, вызывают накопление растительных стеролов. Заболевание часто приводит к развитию ксантом и раннему поражению коронарных артерий. Основной диагностической проблемой является сходство с СГ, так как схожие липидные нарушения затрудняют постановку правильного диагноза.

There are only few data on the pathogenicity of ABCG5 and ABCG8. This study aimed to propose a scheme for determining variant pathogenicity and to catalog the putative pathogenic variants in sitosterolemia. Methods This study enrolled 377 consecutive Japanese patients with hyper-low-density lipoprotein cholesterolemia (mean age: 46.5±19.8 years, with 192 men) who have targeted-sequenced data on ABCG5 or ABCG8 (among 21 Mendelian lipid genes for any dyslipidemias) and serum sitosterol levels at Kanazawa University Hospital from 2016 to 2021. Serum sitosterol levels were divided by 0.79 in patients treated with ezetimibe, accounting for the average reduction with this drug. ABCG5 or ABCG8 variants were defined as putative pathogenic if associated with serum sitosterol levels ≥5 µg/mL or homozygous if associated with serum sitosterol levels ≥10 µg/mL. Results Twenty-three ABCG5 or ABCG8 variants (16 missense, 2 nonsense, 2 frameshift, 2 deletion, and 1 splice mutation) were identified. Based on our definition, 11 putative pathogenic variants (median sitosterol level: 10.1 [6.5–17.1] µg/mL) were found in 36 individuals and 12 benign variants (median sitosterol: 3.5 [2.5–4.1] µg/mL) in 14 individuals. Conclusion The scheme proposed for assessing the pathogenicity of genetic variations (ABCG5 and ABCG8) is useful. Using this scheme, 11 putative pathogenic, and 12 benign variants in ABCG5 or ABCG were classified.",10.12997/jla.2024.13.1.53
ABCG5,HGNC:13886,sitosterolemia,MONDO:0008863,Abstract 231: Classification Of Sitosterolemia-associated Mutations In ABCG5 And ABCG8,"
 Background:
 Sitosterolemia is a rare, recessive form of familial hypercholesterolemia and is caused by mutations in ABCG5 and ABCG8. ABCG5 and ABCG8 form an obligate heterodimer that promotes biliary secretion and opposes intestinal absorption of cholesterol and phytosterols. Whole genome and exome sequencing has revealed over 2000 pathogenic or likely pathogenic loss of function mutations of ABCG5 and ABCG8. Missense mutants in clinically confirmed Sitosterolemia are of particular interest for their potential to reveal structure-function relationships in ABCG5/ABCG8. Recent advancements demonstrate efficacy of two classes of compounds that enhance activity (Potentiators) or rescue (Correctors) disease-causing mutants of multiple ABC transporters. This presents the opportunity to classify missense mutants of ABCG5 and ABCG8 and examine their rescue by these compounds.
 
 
 Methods:
 We mapped 57 missense mutants of ABCG5 and ABCG8 onto the primary protein structure of each half transporter. Mutants were generated through site-directed mutagenesis and confirmed with Sanger sequencing. Plasmids encoding normal and mutant proteins were co-transfected into human Huh-7 hepatocytes and analyzed for maturation by the appearance of the higher molecular weight forms of each glycoprotein in SDS-PAGE. Subcellular localization was determined by immunofluorescence microscopy and cell-surface biotinylation.
 
 
 Results:
 Mutations in ABCG5 and ABCG8 cluster in the nucleotide binding domain and transmembrane spanning domain of each half-transporter. Of the mutants analyzed, 57% were maturation-incompetent and potentially capable for rescue by Correctors. Most maturation-competent mutants were located on the cell surface suggesting they may be amenable to enhanced activity by Potentiators. However, several maturation-competent mutants displayed intracellular staining patterns and are unlikely to benefit from either class of compounds.
 
 
 Conclusion:
 Formation and trafficking of the ABCG5 ABCG8 heterodimer provides insight into ABC transporters and diseases associated with loss of function alleles. Partial rescue of disease-causing mutants within ABCG5 and ABCG8 may be feasible with regulators of proteostasis and small molecule chaperones.

ABCG5,HGNC:13886,sitosterolemia,MONDO:0008863,Screening of ABCG5 and ABCG8 Genes for Sitosterolemia in a Familial Hypercholesterolemia Cascade Screening Program,"Background: Sitosterolemia is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by homozygous or compound heterozygous variants in ABCG5/ABCG8. The disease is characterized by increased plasma plant sterols. Small case series suggest that patients with sitosterolemia have wide phenotypic heterogeneity with great variability on either plasma cholesterol levels or development of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The present study aims to characterize the prevalence and clinical features of sitosterolemia participating in a familial hypercholesterolemia genetic cascade screening program. Methods: From 443 familial hypercholesterolemia index cases, 260 were negative for familial hypercholesterolemia genes and were sequenced for the ABCG5/8 genes. Clinical and laboratory characteristics of affected individuals were determined. Results: Eight (3.1%) index cases were found to be homozygous or compound heterozygous variant for ABCG5/ABCG8 genes, confirming the genetic diagnosis of sitosterolemia. Screening their relatives led to the identification of 6 additional confirmed sitosterolemia cases (3 homozygous and 3 compound heterozygous variant) and 18 carriers (heterozygous). The mean age of identified sitosterolemia cases (n=14) was 37.2±19.8 years, 50% were females, and 78.6% (all adults) presented either clinical or subclinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. As expected, affected individuals presented elevated plasma plant sterol levels (mean β-Sitosterol and campesterol, respectively, 160.3±107.1 and 32.0±19.6 µg/mL) and the highest plasma LDL (low-density lipoprotein)-cholesterol was 269.0±120.0 mg/dL (range: 122–521 mg/dL). LDL-cholesterol mean reduction with therapy among cases was 65%. Eighty-three percent (83%) of identified sitosterolemia patients presented hematologic abnormalities.

Sitosterolemia is a rare genetic disorder directly associated with dysfunction of ABCG5 and G8 genes. The data obtained was used to analyze the cellular mechanisms and the role of transporters in absorption and excretion of serum sterols. Thus, to understand the influence of mutations on the development of cardiovascular disease. Aim. To investigate the clinical manifestation between sitosterolemia and familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), focusing on how dysfunctions of transporters lead to the misdiagnosis of sitosterolemia as FH. Research Strategy.The data collection was conducted by searching research papers in English based on lipidology. The search strategy identified 118 papers, of which 42 were selected that meet established inclusion criteria: full-text publications in English, meta-analyses, cohort studies, experiments on mice, whereas established exclusion criteria: research papers in other languages, promotional articles, conferences, short reports. The research papers reviewed the span from 1970 to 2022. Results. Inactivation of genes causes the dysregulation of sterols. FH is characterized by elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), whereas sitosterolemia presents with moderate elevation in LDL-C but dramatic increase in phytosterols. The phenotypic overlap between sitosterolemia and FH complicates detection. Both disorders manifest cardiovascular complications with elevated total cholesterol (TC) levels. The lipid profile distinguishes these conditions, necessitating HPLC, GC-MS tools. Genetic testing for mutations is essential for confirmation. The findings suggest that sitosterolemia mimics the FH state. FH is managed primarily with statins, while sitosterolemia requires ezetimibe. In addition, dietary modifications that reduce the intake of plant sterols are recommended. Conclusion. This review highlights ABCG5 and ABCG8 mutations that impair sterol transport, causing plant sterol accumulation. The condition often leads to xanthomas and early coronary artery disease. A major diagnostic challenge is the overlap with FH, as similar lipid abnormalities can obscure proper diagnosis.
 Введение. Ситостеролемия - это редкое генетическое заболевание, непосредственно связанное с дисфункцией генов ABCG5 и ABCG8. Полученные данные использовались для анализа клеточных механизмов и роли транспортёров в абсорбции и выведении стеролов из организма. Таким образом, целью исследования является понимание влияния мутаций на развитие сердечно-сосудистых заболеваний. Цель. Изучить клинические проявления ситостеролемии и семейной гиперхолестеринемии (СГ), с акцентом на то, как дисфункции транспортёров приводят к ошибочной диагнозу ситостеролемии как СГ. Стратегия поиска. Сбор данных осуществлялся путём поиска научных статей на английском языке, посвящённых липидологии. В ходе поиска было выявлено 118 публикаций, из которых 42 статьи соответствовали установленным критериям включения: полнотекстовые публикации на английском языке, метаанализы, исследования пациентов, эксперименты на мышах. Исключались статьи на других языках, рекламные материалы, материалы конференций и краткие отчёты. Обзор охватывал исследования, опубликованные в период с 1970 по 2022 годы. Результаты. Инактивация генов приводит к дисрегуляции транспорта стеролов. Для СГ характерно повышение уровня липопротеинов низкой плотности (ЛПНП), в то время как ситостеролемия сопровождается умеренным увеличением ЛПНП, но значительным повышением уровня фитостеролов. Фенотипическое сходство между ситостеролемией и СГ затрудняет их диагностику. Оба заболевания сопровождаются сердечно-сосудистыми осложнениями и повышением общего холестерина (ОХ). Липидный профиль позволяет различать эти состояния, для чего требуются такие методы, как ВЭЖХ и ГХ-МС. Генетическое тестирование на наличие мутаций является необходимым для подтверждения диагноза. Полученные данные показывают, что ситостеролемия имитирует состояние, схожее с СГ. Основной метод лечения СГ — использование статинов, тогда как для ситостеролемии требуется назначение эзетимиба. Кроме того, рекомендуется изменение рациона с ограничением потребления растительных стеролов. Вывод. Обзор подчеркивает, что мутации в генах ABCG5 и ABCG8, нарушающие транспорт стеролов, вызывают накопление растительных стеролов. Заболевание часто приводит к развитию ксантом и раннему поражению коронарных артерий. Основной диагностической проблемой является сходство с СГ, так как схожие липидные нарушения затрудняют постановку правильного диагноза.
 Кіріспе. Ситостеролемия – ABCG5 және ABCG8 гендерінің дисфункциясымен тікелей байланысты сирек кездесетін генетикалық ауру.

Іздеу стратегиясы. Мәліметтер жинау липидология саласындағы ағылшын тіліндегі ғылыми мақалаларды іздеу арқылы жүзеге асырылды. Іздеу нәтижесінде 118 жарияланым анықталып, олардың 42-сі іріктеу критерийлеріне сәйкес келді: толық мәтінді ағылшын тіліндегі мақалалар, метаанализдер, когорттық зерттеулер, тышқандармен эксперименттер. Іріктеу критерийлеріне сәйкес келмегендер: басқа тілдердегі зерттеулер, жарнамалық материалдар, конференция материалдары және қысқаша есептер. Зерттеулер 1970-2022 жылдар аралығын қамтыды. Нәтижелер. Гендердің инактивациясы стеролдардың реттелуін бұзады. Отбасылық гиперхолестеринемия кезінде төмен тығыздықтағы липопротеидтердің (ТТЛП) деңгейі жоғарылайды, ал ситостеролемия кезінде ТТЛП деңгейі орташа деңгейде болса да, фитостеролдардың күрт өсуі байқалады. Ситостеролемия мен отбасылық гиперхолестеринемия арасындағы фенотиптік ұқсастық олардың диагностикасын қиындатады. Екі ауру да жалпы холестериннің (ЖХ) жоғарылауымен және жүрек-қан тамырлары асқынуларымен сипатталады.

ABCG5,HGNC:13886,sitosterolemia 1,MONDO:0020747,Abstract 231: Classification Of Sitosterolemia-associated Mutations In ABCG5 And ABCG8,"
 Background:
 Sitosterolemia is a rare, recessive form of familial hypercholesterolemia and is caused by mutations in ABCG5 and ABCG8. ABCG5 and ABCG8 form an obligate heterodimer that promotes biliary secretion and opposes intestinal absorption of cholesterol and phytosterols. Whole genome and exome sequencing has revealed over 2000 pathogenic or likely pathogenic loss of function mutations of ABCG5 and ABCG8. Missense mutants in clinically confirmed Sitosterolemia are of particular interest for their potential to reveal structure-function relationships in ABCG5/ABCG8. Recent advancements demonstrate efficacy of two classes of compounds that enhance activity (Potentiators) or rescue (Correctors) disease-causing mutants of multiple ABC transporters. This presents the opportunity to classify missense mutants of ABCG5 and ABCG8 and examine their rescue by these compounds.
 
 
 Methods:
 We mapped 57 missense mutants of ABCG5 and ABCG8 onto the primary protein structure of each half transporter. Mutants were generated through site-directed mutagenesis and confirmed with Sanger sequencing. Plasmids encoding normal and mutant proteins were co-transfected into human Huh-7 hepatocytes and analyzed for maturation by the appearance of the higher molecular weight forms of each glycoprotein in SDS-PAGE. Subcellular localization was determined by immunofluorescence microscopy and cell-surface biotinylation.
 
 
 Results:
 Mutations in ABCG5 and ABCG8 cluster in the nucleotide binding domain and transmembrane spanning domain of each half-transporter. Of the mutants analyzed, 57% were maturation-incompetent and potentially capable for rescue by Correctors. Most maturation-competent mutants were located on the cell surface suggesting they may be amenable to enhanced activity by Potentiators. However, several maturation-competent mutants displayed intracellular staining patterns and are unlikely to benefit from either class of compounds.
 
 
 Conclusion:
 Formation and trafficking of the ABCG5 ABCG8 heterodimer provides insight into ABC transporters and diseases associated with loss of function alleles. Partial rescue of disease-causing mutants within ABCG5 and ABCG8 may be feasible with regulators of proteostasis and small molecule chaperones.

ABCG8,HGNC:13887,sitosterolemia,MONDO:0008863,Abstract 452: Classification And Effect Of Correctors On ABCG8 Sitosterolemia Associated Cytosolic Mutants,"
 Background:
 Sitosterolemia is a rare form of Familial Hypercholesterolemia (FH) which is unique from other forms of FH due to the accumulation of phytosterols in the plasma and tissues. Sitosterolemia is autosomal recessive and caused by mutations in either the ABCG5 or ABCG8 gene. ABCG5 and ABCG8 form a heterodimer (ABCG5/ABCG8) that functions at the apical surface of hepatocytes and enterocytes to promote cholesterol and phytosterol excretion. Small molecule modulators classified as either correctors or potentiators have therapeutic benefit when used to treat mutants of ABCB4 (PFIC3) or ABCC7 (Cystic Fibrous) that have impaired folding, stability, or activity. There are over 40 missense mutations in ABCG5/ABCG8 which have been clinically confirmed in patients with Sitosterolemia.
 
 
 Methods:
 We developed a classification system for ABCG5 and ABCG8 mutations based on the underlying molecular defect for ABCG5/ABCG8 dysfunction (maturation, trafficking, activity, etc.). We used site directed mutagenesis to introduce ABCG8 missense mutations located in the N-terminal, cytosolic domain of human ABCG8. Normal and mutant ABCG5/ABCG8 constructs were transiently transfected into a human hepatocyte cell line, Huh-7, and analyzed for heterodimerization, trafficking beyond the ER, and localization at the cell surface.
 
 
 Results:
 Of the ABCG8 cytosolic mutants studied, R184H, L196Q, L228P, and R263Q failed to traffic beyond the ER to form a stable heterodimer (class II) while P231T, T400K, N409D, N409I, and P415H were trafficking competent.
 
 
 Conclusions:
 Forty four percent (4 of 9) of cytosolic, ABCG8 mutations that cause Sitosterolemia are due to failures in complex formation and trafficking beyond the ER. Fifty six (5 of 9) percent were trafficking competent, indicating a stable ABCG5/G8 complex, but loss of activity due to impaired ATP hydrolysis or substrate binding. ABCG8 mutants may be potentially restored by proteostatic regulators and/or potentiators & correctors that have shown to be effective in disease-causing mutations in other ABC transporters.

ABCG8,HGNC:13887,sitosterolemia,MONDO:0008863,Sitosterolemia caused by mutations in the ABCG8 gene. First case report in Colombia,"Introduction: Sitosterolemia is an autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in the ABCG5 or ABCG8 genes. It is characterized by reduced excretion of plant sterols and cholesterol, leading to the development of hypercholesterolemia, xanthomas, and premature atherosclerosis. The present article reports the first case of this disease in Colombia.
Case presentation: A 5-year-old child, son of non-consanguineous parents, who was under active treatment with ezetimibe and cholestyramine was taken (April 2021) to the human genetics service of a healthcare institution in Bogotá, Colombia, for assessment due to multiple xanthomas and elevated LDL cholesterol levels. Familial hypercholesterolemia had been ruled out. A next-generation gene sequencing (NGS) analysis detected a mutation in the ABCG8 gene, so he was diagnosed with sitosterolemia. Pharmacological treatment (ezetimibe and cholestyramine) was continued and dietary modifications were started. In the last follow-up visit of the patient to the human genetics service (March 2022), an improvement in the lipid profile was observed. In addition, 9 months later (December 2022), a decrease in the size of the xanthomas was reported in an evaluation by the pediatric endocrinology service.
Conclusion: Sitosterolemia is a rare disease that should be considered in pediatric patients with multiple xanthomas and in whom familial hypercholesterolemia has been ruled out. Performing NGS of the genes involved is important to make a timely diagnosis and initiate appropriate treatment, which will improve the prognosis and quality of life of these patients.",10.15446/revfacmed.v71n4.107181

ABCG8,HGNC:13887,sitosterolemia,MONDO:0008863,Screening of ABCG5 and ABCG8 Genes for Sitosterolemia in a Familial Hypercholesterolemia Cascade Screening Program,"Background: Sitosterolemia is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by homozygous or compound heterozygous variants in ABCG5/ABCG8. The disease is characterized by increased plasma plant sterols. Small case series suggest that patients with sitosterolemia have wide phenotypic heterogeneity with great variability on either plasma cholesterol levels or development of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The present study aims to characterize the prevalence and clinical features of sitosterolemia participating in a familial hypercholesterolemia genetic cascade screening program. Methods: From 443 familial hypercholesterolemia index cases, 260 were negative for familial hypercholesterolemia genes and were sequenced for the ABCG5/8 genes. Clinical and laboratory characteristics of affected individuals were determined. Results: Eight (3.1%) index cases were found to be homozygous or compound heterozygous variant for ABCG5/ABCG8 genes, confirming the genetic diagnosis of sitosterolemia. Screening their relatives led to the identification of 6 additional confirmed sitosterolemia cases (3 homozygous and 3 compound heterozygous variant) and 18 carriers (heterozygous). The mean age of identified sitosterolemia cases (n=14) was 37.2±19.8 years, 50% were females, and 78.6% (all adults) presented either clinical or subclinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. As expected, affected individuals presented elevated plasma plant sterol levels (mean β-Sitosterol and campesterol, respectively, 160.3±107.1 and 32.0±19.6 µg/mL) and the highest plasma LDL (low-density lipoprotein)-cholesterol was 269.0±120.0 mg/dL (range: 122–521 mg/dL). LDL-cholesterol mean reduction with therapy among cases was 65%. Eighty-three percent (83%) of identified sitosterolemia patients presented hematologic abnormalities. Conclusions: Testing genes associated with sitosterolemia in the molecular routine workflow of a familial hypercholesterolemia cascade screening program allowed the precise diagnosis of sitosterolemia in a substantial number of patients with varying LDL-C levels and high incidence of early atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and hematologic abnormalities.",10.1161/CIRCGEN.121.003390
ABCG8,HGNC:13887,sitosterolemia,MONDO:0008863,Abstract 528: Characterization Of Sitosterolemia-causing Mutations In The Extracellular Domain Of Abcg8,"
 Background:
 ABCG5 and ABCG8 form a heterodimer that promotes biliary secretion and opposes intestinal absorption of cholesterol and phytosterols. Whole-genome and exome sequencing has revealed over 2000 variants of ABCG5 and ABCG8, many of which are predicted to be pathogenic or likely pathogenic. Missense mutations in clinically confirmed cases of Sitosterolemia are of particular interest for their potential to reveal structure-function relationships in ABCG5 ABCG8 and other ABC transporter family members. Mutations in ABCG5 ABCG8 with clinically confirmed Sitosterolemia generally cluster within the ATP binding cassette and transmembrane spanning segments that form the substrate-binding domain. However, four disease-causing mutations occur in the short extracellular loop in ABCG8, suggesting that these mutations may reveal novel elements of the ABCG5 ABCG8 function.
 
 
 Methods:
 Mutants of ABCG8 were generated by site-directed mutagenesis. Plasmids encoding normal ABCG5 and normal or mutant ABCG8s were co-transfected into human Huh7 hepatocytes, lysates prepared, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis. Maturation and trafficking of the ABCG5 ABCG8 heterodimer beyond the endoplasmic reticulum was assessed by the appearance of the higher molecular weight, mature form of each glycoprotein.

 Mutants G574R, G575D, and L596R failed to support trafficking of ABCG5 ABCG8 and were designated as Class II mutants causative in Sitosterolemia. Only G574E supported maturation of the ABCG5 ABCG8 transporter in cultured human hepatocytes and remains unclassified.
 
 
 Conclusion:
 Formation and trafficking of the ABCG5 ABCG8 heterodimer is dependent on key residues within the third extracellular loop in ABCG8. Maturation of ABCG5 ABCG8 is tolerant of substitutions in glycine 574, including the addition of a larger and negatively charged residue. However, neither substitution forms a functional ABCG5 ABCG8 transporter.

ABCG8,HGNC:13887,sitosterolemia,MONDO:0008863,Sitosterolemia: Twenty Years of Discovery of the Function of ABCG5 ABCG8,"Sitosterolemia is a lipid disorder characterized by the accumulation of dietary xenosterols in plasma and tissues caused by mutations in either ABCG5 or ABCG8. ABCG5 ABCG8 encodes a pair of ABC half transporters that form a heterodimer (G5G8), which then traffics to the surface of hepatocytes and enterocytes and promotes the secretion of cholesterol and xenosterols into the bile and the intestinal lumen. We review the literature from the initial description of the disease, the discovery of its genetic basis, current therapy, and what has been learned from animal, cellular, and molecular investigations of the transporter in the twenty years since its discovery. The genomic era has revealed that there are far more carriers of loss of function mutations and likely pathogenic variants of ABCG5 ABCG8 than previously thought. The impact of these variants on G5G8 structure and activity are largely unknown. We propose a classification system for ABCG5 ABCG8 mutants based on previously published systems for diseases caused by defects in ABC transporters. This system establishes a framework for the comprehensive analysis of disease-associated variants and their impact on G5G8 structure–function.",10.3390/ijms22052641
ABCG8,HGNC:13887,sitosterolemia,MONDO:0008863,ABCG5 and ABCG8 gene variations associated with sitosterolemia and platelet dysfunction,"Sitosterolemia (OMIM 210250) is a rare inherited autosomal recessive disorder of lipid metabolism, characterized by increased levels of plasma plant sterols (PS) such as stigmasterol, campesterol, and sitosterol [1,2]. Only around 100 patients with sitosterolemia have been reported so far, but the exact frequency of this disease is still unknown and maybe as high as 1 in 200,000 general population [1]. It is caused by molecular pathology in two genes named adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette (ABC) subfamily G members 5 and 8 (ABCG5 and ABCG8). These genes encode sterolin-1 or ABCG5 (651aa, UniProtKB-Q9H222) and sterolin-2 or ABCG8 (673aa, UniProtKB-Q9H221), respectively, which regulate the network of absorption and excretion of sitosterol and cholesterol [3]. ABCG5 and ABCG8 are ATP-binding cassette (ABC) half-transporters, which form an obligate heterodimer (ABCG5/ABCG8) able to move to the apical surface of cells and then to mediate Mg2+and ATP-dependent sterol transport across the cell membrane [4,5]. As other members of the ABC transporter family, its structure consists of an extracellular domain (ECD) that is in intimate contact with a compact transmembrane domain (TMD), which consists of six transmembrane helices (TMHs). The nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) is located N-terminal from the TMD and maintains a tightly closed dimer. At each NBDs, the ABC cassette and the TMD are in close proximity to a triple-helical bundle that consists of the connecting helix (CnH), the coupling helix (CpH) and the E-helix. The conserved Q-loop of ABC proteins is also located in this region. The triple-helical bundle may, therefore, serve as an immediate interface between TMD and NBD. The TMD polar relay is a cluster of polar amino acids located in the transmembrane segments and on the triple-helical bundles [5]. Despite the molecular mechanism by which ABCG5/ABCG8 effluxes sterol from plasma membranes remains to be elucidated, functional abnormalities in these proteins lead to the hyperabsorption and accumulation of PS in plasma [1–5]. Sitosterol is usually the most abundant PS in the diet, particularly in the Mediterranean diet, being present in vegetable oils, wheat germs, nuts, seeds, avocados, chocolate, and margarine. However, it is poorly absorbed (<5%) in healthy subjects [6]. High concentrations of PS in plasma and tissue proved extremely toxic in animal models and humans [5–7]. For this reason, the most frequent symptoms in sitosterolemia are metabolic and lipid abnormalities and premature cardiovascular disease (CVD) (Table I) [1,8–10]. These characteristics are shared with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), a common disorder (1 in 200 general population), making it possible for sitosterolemia to be misdiagnosed as homozygous FH [8,11].",10.1080/09537104.2020.1779926
ABCG8,HGNC:13887,sitosterolemia,MONDO:0008863,Compound Heterozygous Mutations in ABCG5 or ABCG8 Causing Chinese Familial Sitosterolemia.,"BACKGROUND
Sitosterolemia (STSL), also known as phytosterolemia, is a rare autosomal recessive hereditary disease caused by mutations in the ABCG5 or ABCG8 gene. The disease state is caused by disorders in lipoprotein metabolism, and is characterized by tendinous and tuberous xanthomas, elevated plasma cholesterol and phytosterol levels, and thrombocytopenia and hemolytic anemia in several patients. The manifestations of STSL are diverse and can easily be misdiagnosed. In recent years, cases of this disease in children have been reported in succession. There is therefore a need for clinicians to improve STSL identification and early intervention.


METHODS
We evaluated four children with STSL caused by genetic mutations in ABCG5 or ABCG8, as well as their family members, by analyzing their clinical characteristics and performing Trio-whole exome sequencing. The biological consequences of the mutations were analyzed using various bioinformatics software. We also analyzed the consequences of a mutation commonly observed in STSL patients on the structure of the protein involved.


RESULTS
We identified five previously unreported pathogenic mutations of different phenotypes of STSL: ABCG5 NM_022436:c.1337G>A; ABCG8 NM_022437:c.965-1G>A, c.323-1G>C, c.1418C>G, and c.1534G>A. We also report the structural changes brought about by a mutation common in STSL patients, and the possible consequences of these changes.


CONCLUSION
Our findings further broaden the genotypic and phenotypic profiles of the onset of STSL in the pediatric population and provide information for the diagnosis and treatment of this disease.",10.1002/jgm.3185

ABHD12,HGNC:15868,PHARC syndrome,MONDO:0012984,A Novel Compound Heterozygous Variant in the ABHD12 Gene Cause PHARC Syndrome in a Chinese Family: The Proband Presenting New Genotype and Phenotype,"ABSTRACT Background PHARC syndrome, a rare autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder caused by mutations in the ABHD12 gene, is characterized by demyelinating polyneuropathy, hearing loss, ataxia, retinitis pigmentosa (RP), and early‐onset cataracts. If patients are first diagnosed in the ophthalmology department, they are easily misdiagnosed as having RP or Usher syndrome. This study aimed to identify the genetic etiology and determine the clinical diagnosis of a Chinese family with suspected PHARC syndrome. Method Comprehensive ophthalmic examinations and systemic evaluations were conducted to confirm the phenotype. The genotype was identified through Whole Exome Sequencing (WES), and the current literature was reviewed understand better manifestations of PHARC syndrome related to pathogenic variants. Results The principal symptoms of the proband comprised profound sensorineural hearing loss since childhood, severe visual impairment, congenital cataracts, cone‐rod dystrophy, and ataxia. WES revealed that the proband carried a compound heterozygous variant in the ABHD12 gene: M1, a known nonsense variation c.477G > A (p.Trp159Ter); and M2, a novel copy number variant with a deletion of approximately 18.10 Kbp in chromosome 20p11.21 (seq[GRCh38]del(20) (p11.21)chr20:g. 25302218_25320318del), covering exons 4–12 of the ABHD12 gene. The literature review indicated that there were 65 patients with PHARC from 30 different families. All clinical information of the described patients with PHARC syndrome and all known mutations associated with the disease to date were compiled. Conclusion This study expands the spectrum of pathogenic variants and phenotype for PHARC syndrome and suggests genetic testing is necessary for a definitive diagnosis of PHARC syndrome.",10.1002/mgg3.70055

It is a genetically heterogeneous and clinically variable disease, which is characterized by demyelinating polyneuropathy, hearing loss, cerebellar ataxia, retinitis pigmentosa, and early‐onset cataract and can easily be misdiagnosed as other neurologic disorders with a similar clinical picture, such as Charcot‐Marie‐Tooth disease and Refsum disease. We describe the genotype‐phenotype correlation of two siblings with a novel genotype underlying PHARC syndrome. The genotype was identified using next‐generation sequencing. We examined both patients by means of thorough history taking and clinical examination, nerve conduction studies (NCS), brain imaging, and optical coherence tomography to establish a genotype‐phenotype correlation. We identified a novel homozygous point mutation (c.784C > T, p.Arg262*) in the ABHD12 gene. This mutation was detected in both siblings, who had bilateral hearing loss and cataracts, signs of cerebellar ataxia, and neuropathy with a primarily demyelinating pattern in NCS. In one case, retinitis pigmentosa was also evident. As PHARC syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disorder, our findings highlight the importance of an interdisciplinary diagnostic workup with clinical and molecular genetic testing to avoid a misdiagnosis as Charcot‐Marie‐Tooth disease or Refsum disease.",10.1111/jns.12367

A total of 15 patients from 12 different families were included, with a mean age of 36.7 years (standard deviation [SD] ± 11.0; range from 17.5 to 53.9) at the most recent examination. The presence and onset of neurological, audiological and ophthalmic symptoms were variable, with no evident order of symptom appearance. The mean best-corrected visual acuity was 1.1 logMAR (SD ± 0.9; range from 0.1 to 2.8; equivalent to 20/250 Snellen) and showed a trend of progressive decline. Different types of cataract were observed in 13 out of 15 patients (87%), which also included congenital forms of cataract. Fundus examination revealed macular involvement in all patients, ranging from alterations of the retinal pigment epithelium to macular atrophy. Intraretinal spicular hyperpigmentation was observed in 7 out of 15 patients (47%). From an ophthalmic perspective, clinical manifestations in patients with PHARC demonstrate variability with regard to their onset and severity.

The syndrome is caused by mutations in the ABHD12 gene, which encodes αβ-hydrolase domain-containing protein 12 related to endocannabinoid metabolism. PHARC syndrome is one of the rare diseases; so far, only 51 patients have been reported in the literature. Methods We evaluated the 25-year-old male patient referred to us due to vision loss, cataracts, and hearing loss. Ophthalmological examinations and genetic analyses were performed using targeted next-generation sequencing. Results In the genetic analysis, the patient was diagnosed with PHARC syndrome by detecting homozygous (NM_001042472.3): c.871del (p.Tyr291IlefsTer28) novel pathogenic variation in the ABHD12 gene.

Conclusions In this study, we report a novel variation in ABHD12 gene in the first Turkish-origin PHARC patient. We present this study to contribute genotype-phenotype correlation of PHARC syndrome and emphasize the importance of molecular genetic diagnosis in order to determine the appropriate clinical approach.

Visual acuity was 0 and 1.3 (logMAR) on the right eye (OD) and left eye (OS), respectively. There was pseudophakia in the OS. Fundus examination in OD was normal and pale optic nerve, attenuated vessels, cystoid macular edema, and mid-peripheral bony spicules were found in OS.

ABHD5,HGNC:21396,Dorfman-Chanarin disease,MONDO:0010155,CGI‐58/ABHD5 gene is mutated in Dorfman–Chanarin syndrome,"I read with interest the report by El-Kabbany et al. [2003] on an Egyptian child with typical Dorfman–Chanarin syndrome (DCS). In fact, the causative gene in this disorder is already known. The authors claim that this autosomal recessive disease may have an Arabic origin since the majority of cases are from Middle Eastern countries. Nevertheless patients from French [Kaassis et al., 1998], Spanish [Banuls et al., 1994; Pena-Penabad et al., 2001], Indian [Rajeevan et al., 1999; Tullu et al., 2000], Asian [Chanarin et al., 1975], and American [Igal et al., 1997] origin have been reported, favoring a worldwide distribution. The higher frequency of this syndrome observed in Arabic countries may be related to the great degree of consanguinity encountered in these areas but not by a founder effect as we observed in our genetic studies [Lefèvre et al., 2001]. Secondly, the comments on the pathophysiology of DCS are incomplete. Metabolic studies on cultured cells from DCS patients have shown that the lipid storage was identified as triacylglycerols accumulated as cytoplasmic droplets. No abnormality in uptake, transport or b-oxydation of fatty acids has been found. In the same way, the biosynthetic rate of triacylglycerols was normal in DCS cells. In contrast, pulsechase experiments have demonstrated a block in the degradation pathway [Hilaire et al., 1995] and an abnormal recycling of triglyceride-derived monoor diacylglycerol to specific phospholipids [Igal et al., 1997]. The activities of various enzymes involved in the metabolism of lipids (lipases, cholesteryl esterases, and carboxylesterases) were always found to be in the normal range [Hilaire et al., 1995; Igal and Coleman, 1998]. Because this classical biochemical approach was unsuccessful in explaining the mechanisms of DCS, we recently used a reverse genetic approach [Lefèvre et al., 2001]. We collected 9 families originating from 5 different countries (France, Morocco, Turkey, Tunisia, Algeria) with DCS including 13 affected patients and 35 nonaffected individuals. Linkage with a locus on 3p21 (CNG012, LOD score of 11 at y1⁄4 0) was found and linkage-disequilibrium analysis reduced the locus to a 1.3 Mb region. Two candidate genes involved in the fatty acid metabolism were excluded, but eight distinct mutations (1 insertion, 1 deletion, 2 splice-site, 4 point mutations) in a new gene, CGI-58, were found in the 13 patients. CGI-58 has seven exons, and its mRNA is expressed in skin, lymphocytes, liver, and skeletal muscle. It encodes a 349-amino-acid protein of 39 kDa predicted molecular weight. Analysis of its sequence did not reveal a signal peptide, predicted a cytoplasmic localization, and strong homology with the a/b hydrolase family and the esterase/lipase/thioesterase subfamily. Finally, our identification of CGI-58, recently renamed ABHD5 and mutated in DCS, will permit development of a molecular approach for detection of heterozygotes, prenatal diagnosis, and genetic counseling. It will allow phenotype– genotype correlations and will detect possible heterogeneity in this syndrome.",10.1002/ajmg.a.30228

ACAD8,HGNC:87,isobutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency,MONDO:0012648,A novel ACAD8 mutation in asymptomatic patients with isobutyryl‐CoA dehydrogenase deficiency and a review of the ACAD8 mutation spectrum,"To the Editor : Isobutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase (IBD) deficiency is a very rare autosomal recessive metabolic disorder that is related to valine catabolism. Inherited metabolic disorders (IMDs) with an increase in C4 acylcarnitine include IBD deficiency, shortchain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (SCAD) deficiency, ethylmalonic encephalopathy, multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency and formiminoglutamic aciduria. Most Korean newborns are screened by tandem mass spectrometry for differential diagnosis of various IMDs. We identified two Korean patients with IBD deficiency by newborn screening. They were asymptomatic as newborns, but had characteristic findings in acylcarnitines, organic acids, and mutation analyses. Patient 1 showed an elevated C4 acylcarnitine level (1.67 μmol/l, cutoff: <0.66 μmol/l) with an increased C4/C3 ratio (3.16, cutoff: <0.78) and C4/C2 ratio (0.38, cutoff: <0.13). Patient 2 also showed an elevated C4 level (2.57 μmol/l) with an increased C4/C3 ratio (4.98). In urine organic acid tests, isobutyrylglycine was increased by 1.19 and 3.62 mmol/mol creatinine (cutoff: not detected) in patients 1 and 2, respectively, without elevation of ethylmalonic acid. These findings indicated that the possibility of SCAD deficiency was relatively low. In addition, ACADS sequencing analysis in two patients detected no mutations and lack of the polymorphisms p.R147W and p.G185S, known to be associated with an increased level of ethylmalonic acid excretion. In ACAD8 molecular genetic studies by PCR and sequencing, patient 1 had two mutations: c.289G>A (p.Gly97Arg) and c.1156_1158delCAG (p.Gln386del). Patient 2 had compound heterozygous mutations: c.3G>T (p.Met1Ile) and c.1156_1158delCAG (p.Gln 386del). Two missense mutations, c.289G>A and c.3G>T, have been reported in previous papers (1, 2). The novel mutation, c.1156_1158delCAG, was not found in the single nucleotide polymorphism database (dbSNP; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/) and was not detected in 110 healthy individuals. In addition, we reviewed previous studies of ACAD8 mutations in patients with IBD deficiency. To the best of our knowledge, 20 patients with IBD deficiency have been diagnosed by molecular genetic tests, and 22 ACAD8 mutations have been reported to date (Table 1) (1–7). The nomenclature was updated using Mutalyzer Name Checker (http://www.mutalyzer.nl) based on Human Genome Variation Society nomenclature version 2.0. Among the 22 known ACAD8 mutations, missense mutations are the most common (17/22), and other mutations types include one nonsense, one duplication, one deletion, one initiation codon mutation, and one splicing mutation. The c.455T>C and c.867C>A mutations are frequently observed (10%, 4/40 mutant alleles), 25% of the mutant alleles are located on exon 4, and 80% are located on exons 3, 4, 8, 9, or 10 (Figure 1). In Asia, six patients with IBD deficiency have been reported in the English literature (1, 2, 7). Three of these patients were Korean (including our cases), one was Jordanian, and the other two were East Indian siblings. None of the Asian patients had medical problems, except the Jordanian patient. The initiation codon mutation (c.3G>T, p.Met1Ile) found in the Korean patients affects the start codon, and incomplete transcription and translation might lead to the attenuation of the IBD enzyme (2). It is interesting to note that a small novel deletion of c.1156_1158del (p.Gln386del) was found in two unrelated patients. The glutamine residue at position 386 in the ACAD8 protein is highly conserved across species (http://www.h-invitational.jp/evola/). The activity and the amount of IBD protein may vary according to the ACAD8 mutation, which suggests that the phenotype of IBD deficiency may vary based on the mutation type or locus (6). Two patients with nonsense or frameshift mutations showed clinical manifestations (5, 6), but many cases with missense mutations express no symptoms (1, 2, 5, 6). It is difficult to determine the relationships between missense mutations and phenotypes, and therefore periodic follow-up is necessary",10.1111/cge.12350

Hypertransaminasemia was also noted, with ultrasound evidence of hepatomegaly. Biochemical investigations revealed acylcarnitine and organic acid profiles resembling those seen in MADD, that is, multiple acyl‐CoA dehydrogenase deficiencies (OMIM #231680) a rare inherited disorder of fatty acids, amino acids, and choline metabolism. The patient carried a single pathogenetic variant in the ETFDH gene (c.524G>A, p.Arg175His) and no pathogenetic variant in the riboflavin (Rf) homeostasis related genes (SLC52A1, SLC52A2, SLC52A3, SLC25A32, FLAD1). Instead, compound heterozygosity was found in the ACAD8 gene (c.512C>G, p.Ser171Cys; c.822C>A, p.Asn274Lys), coding for isobutyryl‐CoA dehydrogenase (IBD), whose pathogenic variants are associated to IBD deficiency (OMIM #611283), a rare autosomal recessive disorder of valine catabolism. The c.822C>A was never previously described in a patient. Subsequent further analyses of Rf homeostasis showed reduced levels of flavins in plasma and altered FAD‐dependent enzymatic activities in erythrocytes, as well as a significant reduction in the level of the plasma membrane Rf transporter 2 in erythrocytes. The observed Rf/flavin scarcity in this patient, possibly associated with a decreased ETF:QO efficiency might be responsible for the observed MADD‐like phenotype. The patient's clinical picture improved after supplementation of Rf, l‐carnitine, Coenzyme Q10, and also 3OH‐butyrate. This report demonstrates that, even in the absence of genetic defects in genes involved in Rf homeostasis, further targeted molecular analysis may reveal secondary and possibly treatable biochemical alterations in this pattern.",10.1002/jmd2.12292

Isobutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency is a rare, autosomal recessive hereditary disease caused by a disorder in valine metabolism due to the deficiency of isobutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase.We provided two new mutations for ACAD8 and analyzed new sight to explore the association between the clinical phenotype and genotype of this disease.


METHODS
The concentration of butyrylcarnitine was tested by tandem mass spectrometry. Butyryl carnitine and isobutyryl glycine levels were determined based on urine organic acid analysis. gene mutations was analyzed through gene sequencing.


RESULTS
Five individuals were diagnosed with isobutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency via newborn screening, and new mutations of ACAD8 encoding isobutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase were found. The mutations were c.1166G>A in exon 10 and c.986C>T in exon 9, which were analyzed as pathogenic sites. Both manifested as an increase in butyrylcarnitine and slightly elevated isobutyryl glycine levels. No abnormalities in growth and development were observed during follow-up. Additionally, we summarized 32 types of ACAD8 mutations reported worldwide, analyzed the distribution of mutations with clinical symptoms, and found them to be mainly concentrated in the N-terminal domain and C-terminal domain. These findings may provide new clues for the clinical diagnosis and management of isobutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency.


CONCLUSIONS
In this study, we reported new mutations of ACAD8 and performed a retrospective analysis of isobutyryl CoA dehydrogenase deficiency worldwide. Isobutyryl CoA dehydrogenase deficiency may pose a disease risk during the growth process, thereby requiring long-term follow-up.",10.23736/S2724-5276.21.06179-6
ACAD9,HGNC:21497,acyl-CoA dehydrogenase 9 deficiency,MONDO:0012624,Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and lactic acidosis in a child with acyl-CoA dehydrogenase 9 deficiency. Review of the literature and clinical observation,"Introduction. Acyl-CoA dehydrogenase 9 deficiency (mitochondrial complex I deficiency) is an autosomal recessive disease from the heterogeneous group of disorders of mitochondrial β-oxidation of fatty acids caused by mutations in the ACAD9 gene. The disease is characterized by a wide range of clinical manifestations, the most common of which are metabolic acidosis, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, muscle hypotonicity, and impaired motor skills. The article presents the first Russian clinical observation of a rare variant of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with early debut in a patient with mitochondrial complex I deficiency caused by homozygous mutation c.659C>T (p.A220V) in the ACAD9 gene and emphasizes the importance of early diagnosis of the disease and complex drug therapy to prevent the development of severe complications. 
Objective: to describe the clinical course and management of a patient with the pathogenic c.659C>T (p.A220V) variant of the ACAD9 gene. 
Detailed analysis of anamnesis data, results of clinical, laboratory, instrumental diagnostic methods, and molecular genetic research performed using high-throughput sequencing and direct Sanger sequencing technology. 
The article presents a literature review and detailed data on clinical observation of a child with homozygous c.659C>T (p.A220V) mutation in the ACAD9 gene diagnosed on the basis of the cardiology department of the National Medical Research Center for Children’s Health. Early disease markers and possibilities of complex drug therapy to prevent the development of severe complications are described. 
Conclusion. Disruption of mitochondrial beta-oxidation of fatty acids is a heterogeneous group of inherited diseases due to abnormal mitochondrial beta-oxidation and transport of carnitine and fatty acids in mitochondria. A feature of these diseases is the multisystem nature of the lesion and its progressive course. In some cases, the initial clinical manifestations may be various disorders of the cardiovascular system (cardiomyopathy, heart rhythm disturbances), which may cause death in neonatal period and early childhood. Early molecular genetic research provides accurate diagnosis and, accordingly, timely prescription of complex therapy.",10.46563/2686-8997-2023-4-4-215-225
ACAD9,HGNC:21497,acyl-CoA dehydrogenase 9 deficiency,MONDO:0012624,Understanding ACAD9 function and the physiologic consequences of its deficiency,"Acyl CoA Dehydrogenase 9 (ACAD9) is a member of the family of flavoenzymes that catalyze the dehydrogenation of Acyl-CoAs to 2,3 enoyl-CoAs in mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation (FAO). Inborn errors of metabolism of nearly all family members, including ACAD9, have been described in humans, and represent significant causes of morbidity and mortality particularly in children. ACAD9 deficiency leads to a combined defect in fatty acid oxidation and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) due to a duel role in the pathways. In addition to its function in mitochondrial FAO, ACAD9 has been shown to have a second function as one of 14 factors responsible for assembly of complex I of the electron transport chain (ETC). Considerable controversy remains over the relative role of these two functions in normal physiology and the disparate clinical findings described in patients with ACAD9 deficiency. 
In response to previous non-viable attempts at creating a mouse null for ACAD9 activity, several models were developed using Cre-lox to tailor knockout of the gene in specific tissues as well as allow induction of knockout in all tissues during adulthood. These models proved to have functional and biochemical phenotypes comparable to the affected tissue in humans and allowed testing of several novel therapies to assess their potential for use in humans with ACAD9 deficiency. 
Tissues from these animals were also used to examine a second complex I assembly factor, Evolutionarily Conserved Signaling Intermediate in Toll pathway (ECSIT), and its interaction with ACAD9. ECSIT levels were significantly reduced in the absence of ACAD9. 
These data help elucidate the physiological impact of ACAD9 deficiency, as well as provide new options for therapy of this otherwise untreatable disease. ACAD9 is the most common cause of isolated complex I deficiency in humans, underscoring the public health significance of these studies have relative to diagnosis and treatment.",N/A
ACAD9,HGNC:21497,acyl-CoA dehydrogenase 9 deficiency,MONDO:0012624,Complex I assembly function and fatty acid oxidation enzyme activity of ACAD9 both contribute to disease severity in ACAD9 deficiency.,"Acyl-CoA dehydrogenase 9 (ACAD9) is an assembly factor for mitochondrial respiratory chain Complex I (CI), and ACAD9 mutations are recognized as a frequent cause of CI deficiency. ACAD9 also retains enzyme ACAD activity for long-chain fatty acids in vitro, but the biological relevance of this function remains controversial partly because of the tissue specificity of ACAD9 expression: high in liver and neurons and minimal in skin fibroblasts. In this study, we hypothesized that this enzymatic ACAD activity is required for full fatty acid oxidation capacity in cells expressing high levels of ACAD9 and that loss of this function is important in determining phenotype in ACAD9-deficient patients. First, we confirmed that HEK293 cells express ACAD9 abundantly. Then, we showed that ACAD9 knockout in HEK293 cells affected long-chain fatty acid oxidation along with Cl, both of which were rescued by wild type ACAD9. Further, we evaluated whether the loss of ACAD9 enzymatic fatty acid oxidation affects clinical severity in patients with ACAD9 mutations. The effects on ACAD activity of 16 ACAD9 mutations identified in 24 patients were evaluated using a prokaryotic expression system. We showed that there was a significant inverse correlation between residual enzyme ACAD activity and phenotypic severity of ACAD9-deficient patients. These results provide evidence that in cells where it is strongly expressed, ACAD9 plays a physiological role in fatty acid oxidation, which contributes to the severity of the phenotype in ACAD9-deficient patients. Accordingly, treatment of ACAD9 patients should aim at counteracting both CI and fatty acid oxidation dysfunctions.",10.1093/hmg/ddv074

Infantile cardiomyopathy is the most common phenotype and is usually lethal by the age of 5 years. Riboflavin treatment is known to be effective in ~65% of the patients; however, the remaining are unresponsive to riboflavin and are in need of additional treatment measures. In this report, we describe a patient with ACAD9 deficiency who developed progressive cardiomyopathy at 8 months of age. As the patient’s left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) kept decreasing to 45.4% at 1 year 8 months, sodium pyruvate treatment was introduced together with a beta-blocker and coenzyme Q10. This resulted in a steady improvement, with full and sustained normalization of cardiac function without riboflavin.

Acyl-CoA dehydrogenase 9 (ACAD9), an enzyme assumed to play a role in fatty acid oxidation, was recently identified as a factor involved in complex I biogenesis. Here we further investigated the role of ACAD9's enzymatic activity in fatty acid oxidation and complex I biogenesis. We provide evidence indicating that ACAD9 displays enzyme activity in vivo. Knockdown experiments in very-long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (VLCAD)-deficient fibroblasts revealed that ACAD9 is responsible for the production of C14:1-carnitine from oleate and C12-carnitine from palmitate. These results explain the origin of these obscure acylcarnitines that are used to diagnose VLCAD deficiency in humans. Knockdown of ACAD9 in control fibroblasts did not reveal changes in the acylcarnitine profiles upon fatty acid loading. Next, we investigated whether catalytic activity of ACAD9 was necessary for complex I biogenesis. Catalytically inactive ACAD9 gave partial-to-complete rescue of complex I biogenesis in ACAD9-deficient cells and was incorporated in high-molecular-weight assembly intermediates. Our results underscore the importance of the ACAD9 protein in complex I assembly and suggest that the enzymatic activity is a rudiment of the duplication event.",10.1093/hmg/ddt521

To examine whether these different phenotypes are due to differences in the VLCAD genotype, we investigated 58 different mutations in 55 unrelated patients representing all known clinical phenotypes and correlated the mutation type with the clinical phenotype. Our results show a clear relationship between the nature of the mutation and the severity of disease. Patients with the severe childhood phenotype have mutations that result in no residual enzyme activity, whereas patients with the milder childhood and adult phenotypes have mutations that may result in residual enzyme activity.

However, it is unclear whether the reduced mitochondrial function is a primary or acquired defect in this process. To determine whether primary defects in mitochondrial β-oxidation can cause insulin resistance, we studied mice with a deficiency of long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (LCAD), a key enzyme in mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation. Here, we show that LCAD knockout mice develop hepatic steatosis, which is associated with hepatic insulin resistance, as reflected by reduced insulin suppression of hepatic glucose production during a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp. The defects in insulin action were associated with an ≈40% reduction in insulin-stimulated insulin receptor substrate-2-associated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity and an ≈50% decrease in Akt2 activation. These changes were associated with increased PKCε activity and an aberrant 4-fold increase in diacylglycerol content after insulin stimulation. The increase in diacylglycerol concentration was found to be caused by de novo synthesis of diacylglycerol from medium-chain acyl-CoA after insulin stimulation. These data demonstrate that primary defects in mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation capacity can lead to diacylglycerol accumulation, PKCε activation, and hepatic insulin resistance.",10.1073/pnas.0707060104

Genetic defects are being increasingly recognized in the etiology of primary cardiomyopathy (CM). Very-long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (VLCAD) catalyzes the first step in the beta-oxidation spiral of fatty acid metabolism, the crucial pathway for cardiac energy production.


METHODS AND RESULTS
We studied 37 patients with CM, nonketotic hypoglycemia and hepatic dysfunction, skeletal myopathy, or sudden death in infancy with hepatic steatosis, features suggestive of fatty acid oxidation disorders. Single-stranded conformational variance was used to screen genomic DNA. DNA sequencing and mutational analysis revealed 21 different mutations on the VLCAD gene in 18 patients. Of the mutations, 80% were associated with CM. Severe CM in infancy was recognized in most patients (67%) at presentation. Hepatic dysfunction was common (33%). RNA blot analysis and VLCAD enzyme assays showed a severe reduction in VLCAD mRNA in patients with frame-shift or splice-site mutations and absent or severe reduction in enzyme activity in all.


CONCLUSIONS
Infantile CM is the most common clinical phenotype of VLCAD deficiency. Mutations in the human VLCAD gene are heterogeneous. Although mortality at presentation is high, both the metabolic disorder and cardiomyopathy are reversible.",10.1161/01.CIR.99.10.1337
ACADL,HGNC:88,long chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency,MONDO:0020531,Identification of Very-Long-Chain Acyl-CoA Dehydrogenase Deficiency in Three Patients Previously Diagnosed with Long-Chain Acyl-CoA Dehydrogenase Deficiency,"ABSTRACT: Long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (LCAD) deficiency is a disorder of fatty acid β-oxidation. Its diagnosis has been made based on the reduced activity of palmitoyl-CoA dehydrogenation, i.e., in fibroblasts. We previously showed that in immunoblot analysis, an LCAD band of normal size and intensity was detected in fibroblasts from all LCAD-deficient patients tested. In the present study, we amplified via polymerase chain reaction and sequenced LCAD cDNA from three of these LCAD-deficient cell lines, and found perfectly normal LCAD sequences in two of them, indicating that at least these patients were not deficient in LCAD. The third patient was homozygous for an A to C substitution at 997, although it is unknown whether or not 997-C is a normal polymorphism. Although the LCAD sequence data were puzzling, a new enzyme, very-long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (VLCAD), was recently identified. Because VLCAD also has high activity with palmitoyl-CoA as substrate, it was possible that defective VLCAD may cause reduced palmitoyl-CoA dehydrogenating activity. We performed immunoblot analysis of VLCAD in six “LCAD-deficient” patients; VLCAD was negative in three of them, two of whom had a normal LCAD cDNA sequence. These results indicated that a considerable number of the patients who had previously been diagnosed as having LCAD deficiency in fact have VLCAD deficiency.",10.1203/00006450-199307000-00025
ACADL,HGNC:88,long chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency,MONDO:0020531,Molecular basis of human mitochondrial very-long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency causing cardiomyopathy and sudden death in childhood.,"beta-Oxidation of long-chain fatty acids provides the major source of energy in the heart. Defects in enzymes of the beta-oxidation pathway cause sudden, unexplained death in childhood, acute hepatic encephalopathy or liver failure, skeletal myopathy, and cardiomyopathy. Very-long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase [VLCAD; very-long-chain-acyl-CoA:(acceptor) 2,3-oxidoreductase, EC 1.3.99.13] catalyzes the first step in beta-oxidation. We have isolated the human VLCAD cDNA and gene and determined the complete nucleotide sequences. Polymerase chain reaction amplification of VLCAD mRNA and genomic exons defined the molecular defects in two patients with VLCAD deficiency who presented with unexplained cardiac arrest and cardiomyopathy. In one, a homozygous mutation in the consensus dinucleotide of the donor splice site (g+1-->a) was associated with universal skipping of the prior exon (exon 11). The second patient was a compound heterozygote, with a missense mutation, C1837-->T, changing the arginine at residue 613 to tryptophan on one allele and a single base deletion at the intron-exon 6 boundary as the second mutation. This initial delineation of human mutations in VLCAD suggests that VLCAD deficiency reduces myocardial fatty acid beta-oxidation and energy production and is associated with cardiomyopathy and sudden death in childhood.",10.1073/PNAS.92.23.10496

Patients may present during the neonatal period with lethal multi‐organ failure or during adulthood with a myopathic phenotype. VLCADD is included in the Swedish newborn screening (NBS) program since 2010. The study describes the phenotype and biochemical findings in relation to the genotype, enzyme activity, and screening data in a Swedish cohort of pediatric patients with VLCADD. A total of 22 patients (20 diagnosed via NBS between 2010 and 2019, two diagnosed pre NBS) were included. Parameters analyzed were enzyme activity (palmitoyl CoA oxidation rate); ACADVL genotype; NBS results including Collaborative Laboratory Integrated Reports (CLIR) score; biochemical findings; treatment; clinical outcome. A clinical severity score (CSS) was compiled using treatment interventions and clinical symptoms. A possible correlation between CSS and VLCAD residual enzyme activity and NBS CLIR score was analyzed. The most common ACADVL variant (c.848T>C) was identified in 24/44 alleles. Five novel variants were detected. Clinical manifestations varied from asymptomatic to severe. There was a correlation between CSS, residual enzyme activity, and CLIR scores. Most patients diagnosed via NBS had less severe disease compared to those clinically diagnosed. In conclusion, the identified correlation between the NBS CLIR score, residual enzyme activity, and clinical outcome suggests that information available neonatally may aid in treatment decisions.",10.1002/jmd2.12268

Although these inborn errors of intramitochondrial β‐oxidation of fatty acids present with similar findings to Reye's syndrome, there are clinical, laboratory and hepatic histologic differences. Younger age at presentation, history of unexplained sibling death, a previous episode of lethargy, hypoglycemia or acidosis precipitated by fasting stress and only mildly elevated serum transaminases with normal or only mildly prolonged prothrombin time may all suggest an acyl CoA dehydrogenase deficiency. Long‐chain acyl CoA dehydrogenase deficiency is differentiated from medium‐chain acyl CoA dehydrogenase deficiency by younger age at presentation, more profound cardiorespiratory depression, evidence of cardiomyopathy, and sequelae of muscle weakness, hypotonia and developmental delay.

ACADM,HGNC:89,medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency,MONDO:0008721,Population spectrum of ACADM genotypes correlated to biochemical phenotypes in newborn screening for medium‐chain acyl‐CoA dehydrogenase deficiency,"Medium‐chain acyl‐CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MCADD) is the most frequent inherited defect of fatty acid oxidation, with a significant morbidity and mortality in undiagnosed patients. Adverse outcomes can effectively be prevented by avoiding metabolic stress and following simple dietary measures. Therefore, prospective newborn screening (NBS) is being proposed for this condition. However, technical validation of MCADD population screening and assessment of its overall benefit require broadening of the as‐yet‐scarce knowledge of the MCADD genetic heterogeneity unraveled by NBS and its phenotypic consequences. Here, we describe the entire spectrum of sequence variations occurring in newborns with MCADD in the population of Bavaria, Germany, in relation to the biochemical phenotype. Among 524,287 newborns, we identified 62 cases of MCADD, indicating a birth incidence of 1 in 8,456. In all of the 57 newborns available for analysis, two alterations within the MCADD gene (ACADM) were identified. The most prevalent alteration c.985A>G (Lys329Glu) occurred in 27 (47%) newborns in the homozygous and in 18 (32%) in the heterozygous state (63% of defective alleles). The mild folding variant c.199T>C (Tyr67His) was identified in nine individuals, six of them being compound heterozygous with c.985A>G (Lys329Glu). Neither of the prevalent alterations were found in the remaining nine newborns. A total of 18 sequence variations were identified; 13 of them were novel: eight missense mutations, one nonsense mutation, two splice variants, and two small deletions. The remaining five were previously reported in MCADD patients. The ACADM heterogeneity uncovered was larger as anticipated from previous c.985A>G (Lys329Glu) carrier screening data. In addition, we show that MCADD appears to occur as frequently in Turkish newborns as in the native German population. Our data validate that biochemical NBS for MCADD is a highly specific procedure for disease detection, with the identification of a significant share of milder biochemical phenotypes, such as c.199T>C (Tyr67His). These show statistically lower acylcarnitine markers, allowing us to distinguish subgroups within the spectrum of ACADM sequence variations that correlate to biochemical MCADD disease expression. Our data might provide technical and medical guidance for decision making in the worldwide efforts to introduce MCADD population screening.

ACADM,HGNC:89,medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency,MONDO:0008721,ACADM Frameshift Variant in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels with Medium-Chain Acyl-CoA Dehydrogenase Deficiency,"A 3-year-old, male neutered Cavalier King Charles Spaniel (CKCS) presented with complex focal seizures and prolonged lethargy. The aim of the study was to investigate the clinical signs, metabolic changes and underlying genetic defect. Blood and urine organic acid analysis revealed increased medium-chain fatty acids and together with the clinical findings suggested a diagnosis of medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) deficiency. We sequenced the genome of the affected dog and compared the data to 923 control genomes of different dog breeds. The ACADM gene encoding MCAD was considered the top functional candidate gene. The genetic analysis revealed a single homozygous private protein-changing variant in ACADM in the affected dog. This variant, XM_038541645.1:c.444_445delinsGTTAATTCTCAATATTGTCTAAGAATTATG, introduces a premature stop codon and is predicted to result in truncation of ~63% of the wild type MCAD open reading frame, XP_038397573.1:p.(Thr150Ilefs*6). Targeted genotyping of the variant in 162 additional CKCS revealed a variant allele frequency of 23.5% and twelve additional homozygous mutant dogs. The acylcarnitine C8/C12 ratio was elevated ~43.3 fold in homozygous mutant dogs as compared to homozygous wild type dogs. Based on available clinical and biochemical data together with current knowledge in humans, we propose the ACADM frameshift variant as causative variant for the MCAD deficiency with likely contribution to the neurological phenotype in the index case. Testing the CKCS breeding population for the identified ACADM variant is recommended to prevent the unintentional breeding of dogs with MCAD deficiency. Further prospective studies are warranted to assess the clinical consequences of this enzyme defect.",10.3390/genes13101847

Two novel ACADM mutations are also described. Methods Both patients were diagnosed clinically; follow-up involved analysis of organic acids in urine, acylcarnitines in dried blood spots, and genetic analysis of ACADM. Cut-off values of acylcarnitines in newborns were established using analysis of 10,000 newborns in a pilot screening study. Results In both patients, analysis of the organic acids in urine showed a possible β-oxidation defect, while the specific elevation of acylcarnitines confirmed MCAD deficiency. Subsequent genetic analysis confirmed the diagnosis; both patients were compound heterozygotes, each with one novel mutation (c.861 + 2T > C and c.527_533del). The results from a retrospective analysis of newborn screening cards clearly showed major elevations of MCAD-specific acylcarnitines in the patients. Conclusions An expanded newborn screening programme would be beneficial because it would have detected MCAD deficiency in both patients before the development of clinical signs. Our study also provides one of the first descriptions of ACADM mutations in Southeast Europe.",10.1177/0300060517734123
ACADM,HGNC:89,medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency,MONDO:0008721,[Analysis of clinical characteristics and ACADM gene variants in four children with Medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency].,"OBJECTIVE
To explore the clinical and genetic characteristics of four patients with medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MCADD).


METHODS
Four children who had presented at the Children's Hospital Affiliated to Zhengzhou University between August 2019 and August 2021 were selected as the study subjects. Clinical data of the children were collected. The children were subjected to whole exome sequencing (WES).


RESULTS
All of the four children were diagnosed with MCADD. Blood amino acid and ester acyl carnitine spectrum test showed that the concentration of octanoyl carnitine (C8) was significantly increased. The main clinical manifestations included poor mental response (3 cases), intermittent diarrhea with abdominal pain (1 case), vomiting (1 case), increased transaminase (3 cases), and metabolic acidosis (2 cases). Five variants were identified by genetic testing, among which c.341A>G (p.Y114C) was unreported previously. Three were missense variants, one was frameshift variant and one was splicing variant.


CONCLUSION
The clinical heterogeneity of MCADD is obvious, and the severity of the disease may vary. WES can assist with the diagnosis. Delineation of the clinical symptoms and genetic characteristics of the disease can facilitate early diagnosis and treatment of the disease.",10.3760/cma.j.cn511374-20220611-00402

Methods: This was an observational cross-sectional study with a convenience sampling strategy. The participants were recruited from the blood bank of the Hospital de Clínicas of Porto Alegre, Brazil. A total of 1000 healthy individuals from the state of Rio Grande do Sul were included. Genotyping for the c.199T>C and c.985A>G variants was performed using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and the PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) technique, respectively. Individuals considered heterozygous for c.985A>G were subjected to additional acylcarnitine profile analysis using tandem mass spectrometry. Carrier frequency was obtained by calculating the ratio of heterozygous individuals to the total number of individuals analyzed and reported with a 95% confidence interval. Allele and genotype frequencies were calculated based on the Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium. Results: The c.985A>G variant was detected as heterozygotes in three individuals (frequency of the heterozygous genotype = 1:333, allele frequency = 0.0015, minimum frequency of MCADD = 1:444,444) whose acylcarnitine profiles were within normal limits. The c.199T>C variant was not identified. Conclusions: Considering the small sample size and associated allelic heterogeneity with MCADD, these findings are believed to denote the rarity or underdiagnosis of MCADD in southern Brazil. This study provides evidence for the need for further investigation to ascertain the contribution of these diseases to child morbidity and mortality in the country.",10.1097/RD9.0000000000000021

This article updates a human genome epidemiology review of MCADD published in 1999. The focus of this update is on epidemiologic parameters rather than mutations associated with MCADD. Currently available information from screening studies on the frequency of detection of MCADD in newborns, as well as the frequency of homozygotes for the common mutation in the ACADM gene, is summarized. In the United States, the average incidence of the disorder is from 1 in 15,000 to 1 in 20,000 births, with individual states reporting frequencies from 1 in 10,000 to 1 in 30,000 births. In addition, a systematic review was undertaken of the published literature on the frequency of mortality and developmental disabilities among children with MCADD, both in screened and unscreened cohorts. It seems that in the absence of newborn screening for MCADD, premature death or serious disability occurs in 20% to 25% of children with the disorder. Systematic collection and analysis of follow-up data are still needed to ascertain the frequencies of outcomes in screened cohorts.",10.1097/01.gim.0000204472.25153.8d

Patients exhibit clinical episodes often associated with fasting. Symptoms include hypoketotic hypoglycemia and Reye-like episodes. With limited treatment options, we explored the use of human MCAD (hMCAD) mRNA in fibroblasts from patients with MCAD deficiency to provide functional MCAD protein and reverse the metabolic block. Transfection of hMCAD mRNA into MCAD deficient patient cells resulted in an increased MCAD protein that localized to mitochondria, concomitant with increased enzyme activity in cell extracts. The therapeutic hMCAD mRNA-lipid nanoparticle (LNP) formulation was also tested in vivo in Acadm-/- mice. Administration of multiple intravenous doses of hMCAD mRNA-LNP complex (LNP-MCAD) into Acadm-/- mice produced a significant level of MCAD protein with increased enzyme activity in liver, heart, and skeletal muscle homogenates. Treated Acadm-/- mice were more resistant to cold stress and had decreased plasma levels of medium-chain acylcarnitines compared to untreated animals. Furthermore, hepatic steatosis in liver from treated Acadm-/- mice was reduced compared to untreated ones. Results from this study support the potential therapeutic value of hMCAD mRNA-LNP complex treatment for MCAD deficiency.",10.1093/hmg/ddad076

This study reports on differences in the occurrence of secondary free carnitine (C0) deficiency and different biochemical phenotypes related to genotype and age in 109 MCADD patients followed‐up at a single tertiary care center during 22 years. C0 deficiency occurred earlier and more frequently in c.985A>G homozygotes (genotype A) compared to c.985A>G compound heterozygotes (genotype B) and individuals carrying variants other than c.985A>G and c.199C>T (genotype D) (median age 4.2 vs. 6.6 years; p < 0.001). No patient carrying c.199C>T (genotype C) developed C0 deficiency. A daily dosage of 20–40 mg/kg carnitine was sufficient to maintain normal C0 concentrations. Compared to genotype A as reference group, octanoylcarnitine (C8) was significantly lower in genotypes B and C, whereas C0 was significantly higher by 8.28 μmol/L in genotype C (p < 0.05). In conclusion, C0 deficiency is mainly found in patients with pathogenic genotypes associated with high concentrations of presumably toxic acylcarnitines, while individuals carrying the variant c.199C>T are spared and show consistently mild biochemical phenotypes into adulthood. Low‐dose carnitine supplementation maintains normal C0 concentrations. However, future studies need to evaluate clinical benefits on acute and chronic manifestations of MCADD.",10.1111/cge.14316

Recent advances in spectrometric screening for inborn errors of metabolism have helped detect several metabolic disorders, including SCADD, without symptoms in the neonate period. This allows immediate initiation of treatment and monitoring, so they remain largely symptomless metabolic disease. Here, we report a 15-month-old asymptomatic male, who was diagnosed with SCADD by newborn screening. Spectrometric screening for inborn errors of metabolism 72 hours after birth revealed an elevated butyrylcarnitine (C4) concentration of 2.25 µmol/L (normal, <0.99 µmol/L). Urinary excretion of ethylmalonic acid was also elevated, as detected by urine organic acid analysis. To confirm the diagnosis of SCADD, direct sequencing analysis of 10 coding exons and the exon-intron boundaries of the ACADS gene were performed. Subsequent sequence analysis revealed compound heterozygous missense mutations c.164C>T (p.Pro55Leu) and c.1031A>G (p.Glu344Gly) on exons 2 and 9, respectively.

Analyte testing for SCADD in blood and urine, including newborn screening (NBS) using tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) on dried blood spots (DBSs), is complicated by the presence of two relatively common ACADS variants (c.625G>A and c.511C>T). Individuals homozygous for these variants or compound heterozygous do not have clinical disease but do have reduced short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (SCAD) activity, resulting in elevated blood and urine metabolites. As part of a larger study of the potential role of exome sequencing in NBS in California, we reviewed ACADS sequence and MS/MS data from DBSs from a cohort of 74 patients identified to have SCADD. Of this cohort, approximately 60% had one or more of the common variants and did not have the two rare variants, and thus would need no further testing. Retrospective analysis of ethylmalonic acid, glutaric acid, 2-hydroxyglutaric acid, 3-hydroxyglutaric acid, and methylsuccinic acid demonstrated that second-tier testing applied before the release of the newborn screening result could reduce referrals by over 50% and improve the positive predictive value for SCADD to above 75%.",10.3390/ijns6020041

Methods We studied skin fibroblast cultures from patients homozygous for ACADS common variant c.625G>A (n = 10), compound heterozygous for c.625G>A/c.319C>T (n = 3) or homozygous for pathogenic c.319C>T (n = 2) and c.1138C>T (n = 2) mutations compared to fibroblasts from patients with carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2 (CPT2) (n = 5), mitochondrial trifunctional protein (MTP)/long-chain L-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (LCHAD) (n = 7), and medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) deficiencies (n = 4) and normal controls (n = 9). All were exposed to 50 µM menadione at 37°C. Additonal conditions included exposure to 39°C and/or hypoglycemia. Time to 100% cell death was confirmed with trypan blue dye exclusion. Experiments were repeated with antioxidants (Vitamins C and E or N-acetylcysteine), Bezafibrate or glucose and temperature rescue. Results The most significant risk factor for vulnerability to menadione-induced oxidative stress was the presence of a FAO defect. SCADD fibroblasts were the most vulnerable compared to other FAO disorders and controls, and were similarly affected, independent of genotype. Cell death was exacerbated by hyperthermia and/or hypoglycemia. Hyperthermia was a more significant independent risk factor than hypoglycemia. Rescue significantly prolonged survival. Incubation with antioxidants and Bezafibrate significantly increased viability of SCADD fibroblasts. Interpretation Vulnerability to oxidative stress likely contributes to neurotoxicity of SCADD regardless of ACADS genotype and is significantly exacerbated by hyperthermia. We recommend rigorous temperature control in SCADD patients during acute illness. Antioxidants and Bezafibrate may also prove instrumental in their management.",10.1371/journal.pone.0017534

We investigated a patient with isolated 2-methylbutyrylglycinuria, suggestive of a defect in isoleucine catabolism. Enzyme assay of the patient's fibroblasts, using 2-methylbutyryl-CoA as substrate, confirmed the defect. Sequence analysis of candidate ACADs revealed heterozygosity for the common short-chain ACAD A625 variant allele and no mutations in ACAD-8 but a 100-bp deletion in short/branched-chain ACAD (SBCAD) cDNA from the patient. Our identification of the SBCAD gene structure (11 exons; >20 kb) enabled analysis of genomic DNA. This showed that the deletion was caused by skipping of exon 10, because of homozygosity for a 1228G-->A mutation in the patient. This mutation was not present in 118 control chromosomes. In vitro transcription/translation experiments and overexpression in COS cells confirmed the disease-causing nature of the mutant SBCAD protein and showed that ACAD-8 is an isobutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase and that both wild-type proteins are imported into mitochondria and form tetramers. In conclusion, we report the first mutation in the SBCAD gene, show that it results in an isolated defect in isoleucine catabolism, and indicate that ACAD-8 is a mitochondrial enzyme that functions in valine catabolism.",10.1086/303105

SCADD has highly variable biochemical, genetic and clinical characteristics. Phenotypes vary from fatal metabolic decompensation to asymptomatic individuals. Subject and methods A Romani boy presented at 3 days after birth with hypoglycaemia, hypotonia and respiratory pauses with brief generalized seizures. Afterwards the failure to thrive and developmental delay were present. Organic acids analysis with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GS/MS) in urine and acylcarnitines analysis with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) in dried blood spot were measured. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was isolated from blood and polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) were performed for all exons. Sequence analysis of all exons and flanking intron sequences of ACADS gene was performed. Results Organic acids analysis revealed increased concentration of ethylmalonic acid. Acylcarnitines analysis showed increase of butyrylcarnitine, C4-carnitine. C4-carnitine was 3.5 times above the reference range (<0.68 µmol/L). Confirmation analysis for organic acids and acylcarnitine profile was performed on the second independent sample and showed the same pattern of increased metabolites. Sequence analysis revealed 3-bp deletion at position 310-312 in homozygous state (c.310_312delGAG). Mutation was previously described as pathogenic in heterozygous state, while it is in homozygous state in our patient.

ACADS,HGNC:90,short chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency,MONDO:0008722,Deficiency in the short‐chain acyl‐CoA dehydrogenase protects mice against diet‐induced obesity and insulin resistance,"Acyl‐CoA dehydrogenases (CADs) participate in mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation; abnormal fatty acid oxidation is associated with obesity and related metabolic disorders. We decipher the impact of short‐chain CAD (SCAD) on adiposity and insulin resistance. BALB/cBy strain mice derived from BALB/c strain are deficient in SCAD activity because of a spontaneous deletion in the acyl‐CoA dehydrogenases (Acads) gene. Adiposity, lipogenesis, and insulin sensitivity were compared in BALB/c and BALB/cBy mice subjected to high‐fat diets (HFDs). A whole hepatic transcriptome profiling experiment with microarrays was performed to evaluate the mechanisms by which SCAD deficiency protects against insulin resistance. Acads‐deficient mice were significantly resistant to HFD‐induced obesity and insulin resistance as compared with control mice. Reduced obesity results from decreased triglyceride content due to activation of AMPK in liver that would reduce hepatic content of malonyl‐CoA, resulting in decreased hepatic de novo lipogenesis. Improved insulin sensitivity was associated with reduced diacylglycerol content commensurate with reduced PKC‐ε activity and increased protein kinase B (AKT) activation in liver and skeletal muscle. Additionally, Acads‐deficient mice displayed significantly higher expression of the endoplasmic chaperone 78‐kDa glucose‐regulated protein, which was further associated with the AKT activation in the primary hepatocytes. Modulation of SCAD expression may therefore be a novel therapeutic approach to manage and prevent obesity and related metabolic diseases, such as diabetes.—Chen, Y., Chen, J., Zhang, C., Yang, S., Zhang, X., Liu, Y., Su, Z.

ACADSB,HGNC:91,2-methylbutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency,MONDO:0012392,Prospective diagnosis of 2-methylbutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency in the Hmong population by newborn screening using tandem mass spectrometry.,"OBJECTIVE
2-methylbutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency, also known as short/branched-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (SBCAD) deficiency, is a recently described autosomal recessive disorder of L-isoleucine metabolism. Only 4 affected individuals in 2 families have been described. One patient developed athetoid cerebral palsy, and another had severe motor developmental delay with muscle atrophy. A sibling of the first patient is asymptomatic after prenatal diagnosis and early treatment. Family investigations in the second family revealed that the patient's mother was also affected but asymptomatic.


METHODS
We report 8 additional patients identified by prospective newborn screening using tandem mass spectrometry.


RESULTS
Molecular genetic analysis performed for 3 of these patients revealed that all are homozygous for an 1165A>G mutation that causes skipping of exon 10 of the SBCAD gene. Although there was no obvious consanguinity, all patients belong to the Hmong, an ancient ethnic group that originated in China and constitutes only 0.8% and 0.6% of the Minnesota and Wisconsin population, respectively. Dietary treatment was initiated in the neonatal period. Except for 1 patient who developed mild muscle hypotonia, all patients remain asymptomatic at ages ranging from 3 to 14 months of age.


CONCLUSIONS
These cases suggest that SBCAD deficiency is another inborn error of metabolism detectable by newborn screening using tandem mass spectrometry. The continued efficacy of long-term dietary therapy instituted presymptomatically remains to be established.",10.1542/PEDS.112.1.74

ACADSB,HGNC:91,2-methylbutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency,MONDO:0012392,2-methylbutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency in Hmong infants identified by expanded newborn screen.,"In April 2000, the Wisconsin Newborn Screening Program implemented tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) technology to expand the newborn screening panel from 13 to 48 disorders, the majority of which are inborn errors of metabolism. Among other tests, this technology measures the acylcarnitine profile from blood spots collected from infants at 24 to 48 hours of age. During the first 5.75 years of expanded screening, 27 infants were identified with elevated C5-acylcarnitine concentrations, an unexpectedly high number for any inborn error of metabolism. For these infants, elevated C5-acylcarnitines suggested a diagnosis of isovaleric acidemia (IVA), a metabolic defect of leucine metabolism. Subsequent testing showed that the infants did not have isovaleric acidemia, but did have 2-methylbutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency or 2-MBAD deficiency, a newly described defect of isoleucine metabolism. (An official abbreviation has not been established for this disorder. Other abbreviations include SBCADD, 2-MBG, and 2-MBCD deficiency.) All but 1 of the 27 infants identified with 2-MBAD deficiency are offspring of Hmong parents. To date, those diagnosed with the disorder in the Hmong community have been largely asymptomatic, though further research is needed to determine whether newborns with 2-MBAD deficiency are at risk for neurodevelopmental disorders.",N/A

ACADSB,HGNC:91,2-methylbutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency,MONDO:0012392,A Case of 2-Methylbutyryl-CoA Dehydrogenase Deficiency,"We report a one-day-old Korean boy with 2-Methylbutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase(2-MBCDase) deficiency detected by urine organic acid and acylglycine analysis, plasma acylcarnitine analysis and confirmed by enzyme assay and Western blot. The patient was born at 35 weeks and three days with oligohydroamnios and premature rupture of membrane for 31 hours, as a second child of healthy non-consanguineous parents. There was no significant family history and spontaneous abortion. He was admitted at NICU under ventilator care due to prematurity, respiratory difficulty, and decreased generalized muscle tone. During the first week of hospitalization, he presented with disseminated intravascular coagulation and sepsis. A grade IV intraventricular hemorrhage on brain sonography was observed on the 7th day after birth with seizure. The clinical course of aggravation and recovery was repeated for one month. In laboratory tests, blood C5-acylcarnitines(isovaleryl/ methylbutyrylcarnitine) and urine 2-methylbutyrylglycine(2-MBG) were markedly elevated; butyrylglycine and isobutyrylglycine were also detected in small amounts in the urine. SBCAD(short branched-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase) enzyme activity was undetectable in cultured skin fibroblasts and Western blot showed no detectable immuno-reactive protein. Molecular analysis of the 2-MBCD gene revealed a polymorphism in the leader peptide region(38G>A; Arg13Lys) and homozygous for a non-coding polymorphism 639T>C. This is the first such case in Korea. This disorder is known to be relatively common in one other oriental ethnic group, the Hmong. The baby has been fed on a maple syrup urine disease(MSUD)-similar diet program, and is still alive and is 26-months-old now. However, he developed significant neurologic complications including communicating hydrocephalus, cerebral palsy, and blindness. Presumably the prematurity and its complications may also attribute to his severe neurologic problems. However, the clinical course was particularly severe, a finding in contrast with the observation from several asymptomatic Hmong cases. The clinical course of 2-MBCDase deficiency could be very variable and careful monitoring and follow up should be considered. (Korean J Pediatr 2004;47:100-105)",N/A

EA presented at three days of age with lethargy, hypoglycemia and apnea. MRI demonstrated ischemic changes bilaterally in parietal and occipital lobes and abnormal EEG. Acylcarnitines in plasma were increased (range 8-22 uM, n=7; nl, 3-10). Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) analysis revealed elevated plasma C5-acylcarnitine (1.4-2.4 μM, nl < 0.4), verified as 2-methylbutyrylcarnitine by gas chromatography-mass speclrometry. Urine 2-methylbutyrylglycine (2-MBG) was consistently elevated (range 8-30 mg/g creatinine, n=6; nl < 8). Intact fibroblast conversion of U-14C-isoleucine to 14CO2 was decreased to 26% of control, comparable to that of BKT deficient fibroblasts. Conversion of 13C6-leucine and 13C5-valine in patient's fibroblasts incubated with L-carnitine revealed no abnormal accumulation of acylcarnitines; in the same cells, there was a 10-fold accumulation of C5-acylcarnitine in comparison to control (consistent with impaired 2-MBCDase activity) when incubated with 13C6-isoleucine and L-carnitine. Western-blot analysis of fibroblasts from EA revealed greatly reduced 2-MBCDase cross-reactive material. Mutation screening in patient fibroblasts revealed a C778T substitution in the 2-MBCDase gene, substituting leucine for phenylalanine at amino acid 222 (L222F); the patient's mother also carried this mutation. In a subsequent pregnancy, the concentration of 2-MBG in amniotic fluid obtained at 15 weeks gestation was 0.27 umol/L (nl < 0.04, n=5), while total C5-acylcarnitine concentration was 1.9 umol/L (nl < 0.7, n=27), suggesting an affected fetus. Cultured amniocytes accumulated excess (10-fold) C5-acylcarnitine when incubated with 13C6-isoleucine and L-carnitine. At 1 year of age EA carries the diagnosis of athetoid cerebral palsy, and continues to manifest impaired visual, motor and cognitive skills. Our studies reveal 1) the first documented case of isolated 2-MBCDase deficiency; 2) a novel mutation in the 2-MBCDase gene; and 3) the first prenatal diagnosis of an affected fetus with 2-MBCDase deficiency, a new inborn error of L-isoleucine metabolism in humans.",10.1097/00125817-200001000-00074

Additional novel variants have been recently detected in the population. The molecular and cellular effects of these previously unreported variants are still poorly understood and require further characterization. To address this problem, we have evaluated the various functions and biochemical consequences of six novel missense variants that lead to mild VLCAD deficiency. Marked deficiencies in fatty acid oxidation (FAO) and other mitochondrial defects were observed in cells carrying one of these six variants (c.541C>T, c.863T>G, c.895A>G, c.1238T>C, c.1276G>A, and c.1505T>A), including reductions in mitochondrial respiratory-chain function and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production, and increased levels of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS). Intriguingly, higher apoptosis levels were found in cells carrying the mutant VLCAD under glucose-limited stress. Moreover, the stability of the mutant homodimer was disturbed, and major conformational changes in each mutant VLCAD structure were predicted by molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. The data presented here may provide valuable information for improving management of diagnosis and treatment of VLCAD deficiency and for a better understanding of the general molecular bases of disease variability.",10.1631/jzus.B2000339

To explore the clinical features and variations of ACADVL gene in 9 neonates with very long chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency (VLCADD).


METHODS
VLCADD was suspected based on the results of neonatal screening by tandem mass spectrometry (MS-MS), with tetradecenoylcarnitine ± tetradecenoylcarnitine/octanoylcarnitine (C14: 1 ± C14: 1/C8) as the mark indexes. Infants with positive outcome were confirmed by sequencing of the ACADVL gene.


RESULTS
Among 9 VLCADD cases, one case lost during follow-up, the observed phenotypes comprised 2 with severe early-onset form, 1 with hepatic form and 5 with late-onset form. Optimal outcome was acquired for all patients except the 2 early-onset cases. In total 16 ACADVL variations were detected among the 9 infants, which included 8 novel variations (c.96-105del GCCCGGCCCT, c.541C>T, c.863T>G, c.878+1G>C, c.895A>G, c.1238T>C, c.1276G>A, and c.1505T>A) and 11 missense variations. There were 9 genotypic combinations, including 1 homozygote and 8 compound heterozygotes. Except for two patients carrying null variations, all had a good outcome.


CONCLUSION
VLCADD is relatively rare in southern China, for which late-onset form is common. Carriers of null variations of the ACADVL gene may have relatively poorer clinical outcome. Above results will provide valuable information for the diagnosis and management of VLCADD.",10.3760/cma.j.issn.1003-9406.2019.04.005

To investigate the clinical and laboratory features of very long chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency ( VLCADD ) and the correlations between its genotype and phenotype.


METHOD
Eleven patients diagnosed as VLCADD of Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine seen from September 2006 to May 2014 were included. There were 9 boys and 2 girls, whose age was 2 d-17 years. Analysis was performed on clinical features, routine laboratory examination, and tandem mass spectrometry (MS-MS) , gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and genetic analysis were conducted.


RESULT
All cases had elevated levels of blood tetradecanoylcarnitine (C14:1) recognized as the characteristic biomarker for VLCADD. The eleven patients were classified into three groups: six cases in neonatal onset group, three in infancy onset group form patients and two in late onset group. Neonatal onset patients were characterized by hypoactivity, hypoglycemia shortly after birth. Infancy onset patients presented hepatomegaly and hypoglycemia in infancy. The two adolescent patients showed initial manifestations of exercise intolerance or rhabdomyolysis. Six of the eleven patients died at the age of 2-8 months, including four neonatal onset and two infant onset patients, with one or two null mutations. The other two neonatal onset patients were diagnosed since early birth through neonatal screening and their clinical manifestation are almost normal after treatments. Among 11 patients, seventeen different mutations in the ACADVL gene were identified, with a total mutation detection rate of 95.45% (21/22 alleles), including eleven reported mutations ( p. S22X, p. G43D, p. R511Q, p. W427X, p. A213T, p. C215R, p. G222R, p. R450H, p. R456H, c. 296-297delCA, c. 1605 + 1G > T) and six novel mutations (p. S72F, p. Q100X, p. M437T, p. D466Y, c. 1315delG insAC, IVS7 + 4 A > G). The p. R450H was the most frequent mutation identified in three alleles (13.63%, 3/22 alleles), followed by p. S22X and p. D466Y mutations which were detected in two alleles (9.09%, 2/22 alleles).


CONCLUSION
The ACADVL gene mutations were heterozygous in our patients. The mortality of neonatal onset form and infant onset form is much higher than the late onset form patients, suggesting a certain correlation between the genotype and phenotype was found. The earlier diagnosis and treatment of VLCADD are of vital importance for the improvement of the prognosis of the patients.",10.3760/CMA.J.ISSN.0578-1310.2015.04.007

According to the clinical and gene mutation characteristics of ACADVL-related very long chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency(VLCADD), the types that contribute to the gene mutation of ACADVL were summarized. 
 
 
Methods 
By analyzing clinical, laboratory and genetic data of 1 case with ACADVL-related very long chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency diagnosed from Department of Pediatrics, the Affiliated Hospital of Inner Mongolia Medical University in August 2016, based on the agreement signed by both the little patient′s parents and the hospital, plus the high-throughput sequencing analysis and PCR sequencing test for the 2 generation genes, some presented mutation sites were analyzed and concluded, in addition to taking "" ACADVL"" as key words to search the databases from CNKI, Wanfang(updated in 2016) as well as PubMed and related documents from On-line Mendal Inheri-tant databases of Man(OMIM) and HGMD. 
 
 
Results 
Through physical examination, VLCADD was diagnosed.After being given Levocamitine and the diet likemedium-chain fatty acid food for a week, the metabolism returned to normal.Tracking him for 3 months, his hepatitis obviously rebounded, within the reach of 3 cm under the right rib and 1 cm under the xiphoid.The exome sequencing study (trios) was identified the novel heterozygous mutation according to the statistics below ACADVL(NM_000018.3) Exon7: c.608C>T; p.(Pro203Leu)(heterozygous)and ACADVL(NM_000018.3) Exon18: c.1748C>T; p.(Ser583Leu)(heterozygous) in ACADVL.Relevant literature reported suggest these two mutations from both the parents are pathogenic genes, which can account for the reason why the boy got ill.However, these two mutations had not been reported in ACADVL-related VLCADD so far.Up to now, 73 types of mutations from documents index were related to the VLCADD, but the clinical case included 75 kinds of gene mutations. 
 
 
Conclusions 
The apparent symptoms of the boy with the gene mutation were reflected in abnormal heart rates, hepatomegaly and hypoglycemia.VLCADD was diagnosed through genetic testing, and systematic treatment can partly control the development of the disease.In conclusion, the findings(exon 7 and 18) show that according to the genetic tests, disease-causing genes from both parents are new mutations of ACADVL and they are pathogenic.

To explore the correlation between clinical classification and genotype and prognosis among Chinese children with Very-long chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (VLCADD).


METHODS
A Chinese pedigree affected with VLCADD admitted at the First People's Hospital of Yunnan Province in February 2019 was selected as the study subject. The characteristics of disease onset, diagnosis and treatment and prognosis were retrospectively analyzed. Relevant literature was also systematically searched and reviewed.


RESULTS
The proband, a 1-year-old boy, had the clinical manifestations of frequently vomiting, hypoglycemia, abnormal liver function and myocardial enzymes. Tandem mass spectrometry screening showed significantly elevated C14, C14:1, C16:1, C16:2, C18 and C14/C8. Genetic testing revealed that he has harbored compound heterozygous variants of the ACADVL gene, namely c.664G>A (p.G222R) and c.1345G>A (p.E449K), which were respectively derived from his father and mother. The child was diagnosed with VLCADD cardiomyopathy type and deceased 2 weeks later. Literature review has identified 60 Chinese children with VLCADD. The clinical classifications were mainly cardiomyopathy type and liver disease type, which accounted for 73.3% (43/60). The combination of ACADVL gene variants were correlated with the clinical classifications of VLCAD. Children with one or two loss-of-function (LOF) mutations showed more severe clinical manifestation and a higher mortality. Cardiomyopathy type had the poorest prognosis, with a mortality rate of 76.9% (20/26). C14:1 may be used as an indicator for the diagnosis of VLCADD, but cannot be used for clinical subtyping and prognosis evaluation. The c.1349G>A (p.R450H) variant had the highest frequency among the Chinese patients, accounting for 10.8% (13/120).


CONCLUSION
The clinical classifications of VLCADD are strongly correlated with the prognosis, and LOF mutations are more common in those with severe clinical manifestations. c.1349G>A (p.R450H) may be the most common variant among the Chinese patients, and early screening and diagnosis can greatly improve the prognosis of patients.",10.3760/cma.j.cn511374-20230306-00111

T2 deficiency is an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder caused by variant in the ACAT1 gene. In this report, we describe two novel ACAT1 variant identified in a Chinese family. Case presentation The 9-month-old male proband was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit for altered consciousness. At the time of admission, the patient had acidosis, drowsiness, and respiratory failure. Both urine organic acid analyses and LC–MS/MS suggested T2 deficiency. Novel compound heterozygous variant (c.871G>C and c.1016_1017del) in the ACAT1 gene were detected in the proband by WES and verified through direct sequencing. Family analysis demonstrated that the first variant was transmitted from his father and the second variant was from his mother, indicating autosomal recessive inheritance. This report is the first to describe the association of these variant with T2 deficiency based on genetic testing. Although these variant were identified in the patient’s elder sister and elder brother, they continue to be asymptomatic.

To investigate the clinical phenotype and ACAT1 gene mutation in a family affected with beta-ketothiolase deficiency (BKTD).


METHODS
Clinical features and laboratory test data were collected. The probands were monozygotic twin brothers. Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood leukocytes obtained from the probands and their family members. Molecular genetic testing of the ACAT1 gene was carried out.


RESULTS
The probands have presented with fever, vomiting and severe ketoacidosis. By arterial blood gas testing, pH was determined to be 7.164, bicarbonate was 4.0 mmol/L, and urine ketone was ++++. Urinary organic acid gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis showed excessive excretion of 3-hydroxybutyric acid, 2-methyl-3-hydroxybutyric acid and tiglylglycine. Increased 3-hydroxybutyrylcarnitine (C4-OH), tiglylcarnitine(C5:1) and 3-hydroxyisovalerylcarnitine (C5-OH) levels. The clinical phenotype of proband's parents were both normal, but an elder sister turned out to be an affected patient. Genetic analysis has identified two heterozygous mutations [c.622C>T(p.R208X) and c.653C>T (p.S218F)] in the proband, which were respectively detected in the mother and father. The c.653C>T (p.S218F) mutation was not found among the 100 healthy controls and has not been included in the Human Gene Mutation Database(HGMD).


CONCLUSION
The primary clinical manifestations of BKTD is ketoacidosis. Urine organic acid and blood acylcarnitine analyses play an important role in the diagnosis of the disease. The compound heterozygous of ACAT1 gene mutations probably underlie the BKTD in our patient.",10.3760/cma.j.issn.1003-9406.2016.03.002

After 1 day of treatment at the local hospital, she was referred to our hospital due to exacerbated conditions including unconsciousness and convulsion. When referring to our hospital, she had metabolic acidosis, hypokalemia, hypernatremia, hyperammonemia, and a Glasgow coma scale of 8 and Kussmaul breathing. Five percent NaHCO3 (24 mL/kg), glucose and insulin (4–6 g glucose/1 U insulin) were continuously infused for correcting acidosis. L-carnitine (350 mg/kg/day) was given for ensuring the energy and increasing exudates of metabolites after admission. Protein was limited at 1.5 g/kg/day.

Scant information is available regarding the incidence, newborn screening (NBS), and mutational spectrum in China.Methods: We collected NBS, biochemical, clinical, and ACAT1 mutation data from 18 provinces or municipalities in China between January 2009 and May 2020, and systematically assessed all available published Chinese BKTD patients data.Results: Totally 16,088,190 newborns were screened and 14 were identified through NBS, with an estimated incidence of 1 per 1 million newborns in China. Twenty-nine patients were genetically diagnosed as BKTD and 12 patients were newly identified. Most patients showed typical blood acylcarnitine and urinary organic acid profiles. In particular, almost all patients (15/16, 94%) showed elevated C4OH levels. Eighteen patients presented acute metabolic decompensations and displayed variable clinical symptoms. The acute episodes of 9 patients were triggered by infections, diarrhea, and vaccination. About two thirds of patients have favorable outcomes, one showed developmental delay, while three had died. Twenty-seven distinct variants were identified in ACAT1, among which 5 were found to be novel.Conclusion: This study presented the largest series of BKTD cohort in China. Our results indicated that C4OH is a useful marker for the detection of BKTD. The performance of BKTD NBS could be improved by adding C4OH to the current panel of C5OH and C5:1 markers in NBS. The mutational spectrum and molecular profiles of ACAT1 in Chinese population were expanded with 5 newly identified variants.",10.21203/rs.3.rs-133651/v1
ACAT1,HGNC:93,beta-ketothiolase deficiency,MONDO:0008760,Two Infants With Beta-Ketothiolase Deficiency Identified by Newborn Screening in China,"Beta-ketothiolase deficiency (BKTD) is an autosomal recessive disease caused by a defect of mitochondrial acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase. Beginning in 2014, we carried out newborn screening by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) followed by next-generation sequencing (NGS) and identified two infants with BKTD among 203,750 newborns born in Jiangsu Province, China. Both infants showed the characteristic chemical abnormalities of BKTD. We used NGS to confirm variants in the ACAT1. Patient 1 had the compound heterozygous variants c.721dupA and c.928G > C. Patient 2 had compound heterozygosity for the c.238+1G > A and c.1163G > T variants. c.721dupA, c.928G > C and c.1163G > T were suspected to be likely pathogenic, whereas c.238+1G > A was determined to be pathogenic. None of the four variants have been reported in the literature. Patient 1 presented with onset of metabolic acidosis and neonatal hypoglycemia 8 days after birth, whereas patient 2 was detected through neonatal disease screening but had no clinical manifestations. These findings contribute to our understanding of the clinical characteristics and genetic basis of BKTD.",10.3389/fgene.2019.00451
ACAT2,HGNC:94,acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase-2 deficiency,MONDO:0013548,The Cholesterol-Binding Translocator Protein (18 kDa) Regulates Hepatic Steatosis and Bile Acid Synthesis in Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease,"Translocator protein (TSPO, 18kDa) levels increase in parallel with the evolution of simple steatosis (SS) to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). However, TSPO function in SS and NASH is unknown. Loss of TSPO in hepatocytes in vitro downregulated acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase 2 (ACAT2) and increased free cholesterol (FC). FC accumulation induced endoplasmic reticulum stress via IRE1A and PERK/ATF4/CHOP pathways and autophagy. TSPO deficiency activated cellular adaptive antioxidant protection; this adaptation was lost upon excessive FC accumulation. 19-Atriol, a TSPO ligand, blocked cholesterol binding and recapitulated many of the alterations seen in TSPO-deficient cells. These data suggest that TSPO deficiency accelerated the progression of SS. In NASH, however, loss of TSPO ameliorated liver fibrosis through downregulation of bile acid synthesis by reducing CYP7A1 and CYP27A1 levels and increasing farnesoid X receptor expression. These studies indicate a dynamic and complex role for TSPO in the evolution of NAFLD.",10.2139/ssrn.3751757
ACAT2,HGNC:94,acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase-2 deficiency,MONDO:0013548,Subclinical ketosis leads to lipid metabolism disorder by down-regulating the expression of Acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase 2 (ACAT2) in dairy cows.,"Ketosis is a metabolic disease that often occurs in dairy cows postpartum and results from disordered lipid metabolism. Acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA) acetyltransferase 2 (ACAT2) is important for balancing cholesterol and triglyceride (TG) metabolism; however, its role in subclinical ketotic dairy cows is unclear. This study aimed to explore the potential correlation between ACAT2 and lipid metabolism disorders in subclinical ketotic cows through in vitro and in vivo experiments. In the in vivo experiment, liver tissue and blood samples were collected from healthy cows (CON, n = 6, β-hydroxybutyric acid [BHBA] concentration < 1.0 mM) and subclinical ketotic cows (subclinical ketosis [SCK], n = 6, BHBA concentration = 1.2-3.0 mM) to explore the effect of ACAT2 on lipid metabolism disorders in SCK cows. For the in vitro experiment, bovine hepatocytes (BHEC) were used as the model. The effects of BHBA on ACAT2 and lipid metabolism were investigated via BHBA concentration gradient experiments. Subsequently, the relation between ACAT2 and lipid metabolism disorder was explored by transfection with siRNA of ACAT2. Transcriptomics showed an upregulation of differentially expression genes (DEGs) during lipid metabolism and significantly lower ACAT2 mRNA levels in the SCK group. Compared with the CON group in vivo, the SCK group showed significantly higher expression levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) and sterol regulator element binding protein 1c (SREBP1c) and significantly lower expression levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα), carnitine palmitoyl-transferase 1A (CPT1A), sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 2 (SREBP2), and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR). Moreover, the SCK group had a significantly higher liver TG content and significantly lower plasma total cholesterol (TC) and free cholesterol (FC) content. These results were indicative of TG and cholesterol metabolism disorders in the liver of dairy cows with SCK. Additionally, the SCK group showed an increased expression of Perilipin-2 (PLIN2), decreased expression of apolipoprotein B (APOB), and decreased plasma concentration of very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) and low-density lipoproteins-cholesterol (LDL-C) by downregulating ACAT2, which indicated an accumulation of TG in liver. In vitro experiments showed that BHBA induced an increase in the TG content of BHEC, decreased content TC, increased expression of PPARγ and SREBP1c, and decreased expression of PPARα, CPT1A, SREBP2, and HMGCR. Additionally, BHBA increased the expression of PLIN2 in BHEC, decreased the expression and fluorescence intensity of ACAT2, and decreased the VLDL and LDL-C contents. Furthermore, silencing ACAT2 expression increased the TG content; decreased the TC, VLDL, and LDL-C contents; decreased the expression of HMGCR and SREBP2; and increased the expression of SREBP1c; but had no effect on the expression of PLIN2. These results suggest that ACAT2 downregulation in BHEC promotes TG accumulation and inhibits cholesterol synthesis, leading to TG and cholesterol metabolic disorders. In conclusion, ACAT2 downregulation in the SCK group inhibited cholesterol synthesis, increased TG synthesis, and reduced the contents of VLDL and LDL-C, eventually leading to disordered TG and cholesterol metabolism.",10.3168/jds.2023-23602
ACAT2,HGNC:94,acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase-2 deficiency,MONDO:0013548,Abstract 2829: Acetyl-CoA Acetyltransferase 2 confers radioresistance by inhibiting ferroptosis and enhancing the phosphorylation of AKT-S473 in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma,"
 Purpose: The overall efficacy of patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is not high due to the lack of markers to evaluate concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) resistance, which is dominated by radiotherapy. The aim of this study is to identify a radioresistant protein from proteomics and explore its molecular mechanism.
 Methods and Materials: The proteomic data of pre-treatment biopsy tissues of 18 ESCC patients with CCRT (complete response CR group, n = 8; incomplete response <CR group, n = 10) was collected, combined with PXD021701 to explore the radioresistant candidate. Subsequently, immunohistochemistry of 126 paraffin embedded biopsies was used for validation. The ESCC cell models with overexpression, knockdown or knockout of Acetyl-CoA Acetyltransferase 2 (ACAT2) were applied for exploring its effects on radioresistance using clonogenic assay underwent ionizing radiation (IR). ROS, C11-BODIPY, Fer-1 (ferrostatin inhibitor) and western blotting analysis were employed to reveal the potential mechanism ACAT2 triggered after IR.
 Results: Enrichment analysis of differentially expressed proteins (<CR vs. CR) showed that the pathways of CCRT resistance molecules in ESCC were related to lipid metabolism, while the sensitive ones were mainly aggregated to immunity pathways. ACAT2 was selected from proteomics and verified as a risk factor of overall survival and a radioresistant factor among ESCC patients with CCRT or radiotherapy by immunohistochemistry. ACAT2 overexpression conferred ESCC cell resistance to IR treatment, whereas the ACAT2 knockdown or knockout ones were sensitive to IR. ACAT2 knockout cells were prone to produce ROS and enhance lipid peroxidation after IR, which was rescued by Fer-1. ACAT2 knockout also inhibited GPX4 and phosphorylation of AKT-S473 site after IR.
 Conclusion: ACAT2 is negatively associated with the response of radiotherapy and prognosis of ESCC patients, suggesting ACAT2 as an effective therapy target to enhance radiosensitivity of ESCC.

ACAT2,HGNC:94,acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase-2 deficiency,MONDO:0013548,An Approach to Identify SNPs in the Gene Encoding Acetyl-CoA Acetyltransferase-2 (ACAT-2) and Their Proposed Role in Metabolic Processes in Pig,"The novel liver protein acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase-2 (ACAT2) is involved in the beta-oxidation and lipid metabolism. Its comprehensive relative expression, in silico non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism (nsSNP) analysis, as well as its annotation in terms of metabolic process with another protein from the same family, namely, acetyl-CoA acyltransferase-2 (ACAA2) was performed in Sus scrofa. This investigation was conducted to understand the most important nsSNPs of ACAT2 in terms of their effects on metabolic activities and protein conformation. The two most deleterious mutations at residues 122 (I to V) and 281 (R to H) were found in ACAT2. Validation of expression of genes in the laboratory also supported the idea of differential expression of ACAT2 and ACAA2 conceived through the in silico analysis. Analysis of the relative expression of ACAT2 and ACAA2 in the liver tissue of Jeju native pig showed that the former expressed significantly higher (P<0.05). Overall, the computational prediction supported by wet laboratory analysis suggests that ACAT2 might contribute more to metabolic processes than ACAA2 in swine. Further associations of SNPs in ACAT2 with production traits might guide efforts to improve growth performance in Jeju native pigs.",10.1371/journal.pone.0102432
ACAT2,HGNC:94,acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase-2 deficiency,MONDO:0013548,Human acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase-2 (ACAT-2) gene was associated with hyperlipidemia in han chinese population: a case-control study,"Background: ACAT2 is a ubiquitous class of enzymes involved in biosynthesis pathway of cholesterol. Hyperlipidemia is a strong predictor for coronary artery disease (CAD). Little is known about the association of ACAT2 gene with hyperlipidemia. The aim of the present study was to assess the relationship between the human ACAT2 gene and hyperlipidemia by conducting case-control study. Methods: A total of 233 hyperlipidemia patients and 526 controls were genotyped for the three SNPs used as genetic markers for the human ACAT2 gene (rs3798211, rs15892, and rs3465). Three SNPs were selected from the HapMap website and genotyped by using TaqMan (Applied Biosystems) Genotyping Assays. Data analysis was performed by using SPSS 17.0 and haploview 4.0. Results: The distributions of the genotypes and alleles in three SNPs (rs3798211, rs15892, and rs3465) were significantly different between the hyperlipidemia patients and the control subjects (all P=0.000, respectively). We have found that the frequencies of all three SNPs were significantly higher in hyperlipidmia patients when compared to the controls in a dominant model and the significance remained after adjusting multivariable confounders, such as sex, age, BMI, SBP, DBP, glucose, smoking, drinking, education and physical activity by using multiple logistic regressions (Odds ratio=1.336, 95% CI: 1.188-1.502; Odds ratio=1.410, 95% CI: 1.034-1.924; Odds ratio=2.754, 95% CI: 1.610-4.114; all P=0.000, respectively). Further, the triglycerides, total cholesterol, and low density lipoprotein-cholesterol concentrations were significantly higher in the TT genotype of rs3798211, and GG genotype of rs3465 when compared to other genotypes of the two SNPs after adjusting age, sex, smoking, drinking, education and physical activity in hyperlipidemia patients and control subjects (all P<0.05). Conclusions: The results of this study indicate that TT genotype of rs3798211, AA genotype of rs15892, and GG genotype of rs3465 in human ACAT2 gene might be the possible risk genetic marker for hyperlipidemia in Han Chinese population.",N/A

ACAT2,HGNC:94,acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase-2 deficiency,MONDO:0013548,Abstract 4139747: Inhibition of Acetyl -CoA Carboxylase 2 (ACC2) enhances fatty acid oxidation and improves cardiac function and survival in a severe model of heart failure,"
 Heart failure (HF) is characterized by disordered energy metabolism including impaired mitochondrial oxidation and altered energy substrate preference. In triglyceride (TG) deposit cardiomyovasculopathy (TGCV; ORPHA code 565612), a rare form of HF characterized by impaired fatty acid oxidation (FAO), massive TG accumulation occurs in cardiac muscle and vasculature due to deficiency of adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL). Since acetyl-CoA carboxylase 2 (ACC2) regulates fatty acid transport into mitochondria for oxidation, we hypothesized that genetic deletion or pharmacologic inhibition of ACC2 may improve cardiac function in the
 Atgl
 knockout (KO) mouse model of TGCV. Relative to
 Atgl
 KO mice,
 Atgl/Acc2
 double KO mice had reduced cardiac TG accumulation and fibrosis, and significant improvements in cardiac function by echocardiography, locomotor activity, and survival (log-rank p <0.0001). These findings were recapitulated by treatment of
 Atgl
 KO mice with TLC-3595, a highly selective, systemic, small molecule ACC2 inhibitor in development for type 2 diabetes (
 Figure
 ). After a single dose of TLC-3595 to
 Atgl
 KO mice, dose-dependent reductions in cardiac malonyl-CoA levels and TG content were observed. Further, in a detailed time-course echocardiographic analysis,
 Atgl
 KO mice had reduced left ventricular ejection fraction and evidence of cardiac remodeling which was ameliorated by TLC-3595 treatment. Metabolomic profiling of cardiac tissue revealed ACC2-specific changes, including reduced malonyl-CoA and increased acylcarnitines, consistent with increased FAO with TLC-3595 treatment. Moreover, levels of TCA cycle metabolites and acetylcarnitine were reduced in
 Atgl
 KO mice but increased with ACC2 deletion or TLC-3595. In summary, ACC2 deletion or pharmacologic inhibition restored cardiac energy metabolism towards increased FAO in
 Atgl
 KO mice, resulting in improved cardiac function and survival. These findings support the therapeutic targeting of ACC2, including with the selective small molecule ACC2 inhibitor TLC-3595, for the treatment of patients with HF associated with FAO deficiency.

Its deficiency was shown to impair peroxisomal beta-oxidation of very long chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) and leads to an autosomal recessive disorder with main findings of retinal dystrophy and leukodystrophy. We report five patients with ages ranging between 4 and 30 years. First presentation was in infancy with nystagmus and photophobia and progressed to legal blindness by 10 years of age. Electroretinogram (ERG) confirmed severe cone-rod dystrophy. Motor neuroregression with variable ages of onset and signs of progressive cerebellar ataxia were seen in all whereas cognitive decline was observed in some. Brain MRI revealed diffuse T2 signal abnormality in deep white matter with involvement of corticospinal tracts. Plasma VLCFA profile showed mild elevation of C26 and C26/22 ratio. Two homozygous variants in ACBD5 gene were identified; exons 7 and 8 deletion and exon 4 deletion. This series confirms retinal dystrophy and leukodystrophy as key features of ACBD5 deficiency with main symptoms of early onset visual decline, progressive spasticity, and cerebellar ataxia. Retinal dystrophy is characterized by early cone involvement. This case series is valuable in adding to the understanding of this ultra-rare neurometabolic disease.",10.5001/omj.2025.34

Presenting features include retinal dystrophy, progressive leukodystrophy, and ataxia. Only seven cases of ACBD5‐related retinal dystrophy have been reported in the literature to date, including one other case diagnosed in adulthood. Here we report a case with novel compound heterozygous ACBD5 mutations, presenting with the common features of rod monochromatism and progressive leukodystrophy with spasticity and ataxia. Additional novel clinical features included head and neck tremor and ovarian insufficiency. The patient's symptoms were present since infancy, but a diagnosis was only reached in adulthood when whole exome sequencing was performed. This case, which reports two novel mutations and additional clinical manifestations, contributes to the emerging phenotype of ACBD5‐related retinal dystrophy with leukodystrophy, and delineation of the natural history and disease progression.",10.1002/ajmg.a.63433
ACBD5,HGNC:23338,acyl-CoA binding domain containing protein 5 deficiency,MONDO:0100112,ACBD5 deficiency causes a defect in peroxisomal very long-chain fatty acid metabolism,"Background Acyl-CoA binding domain containing protein 5 (ACBD5) is a peroxisomal membrane protein with a cytosolic acyl-CoA binding domain. Because of its acyl-CoA binding domain, ACBD5 has been assumed to function as an intracellular carrier of acyl-CoA esters. In addition, a role for ACBD5 in pexophagy has been suggested. However, the precise role of ACBD5 in peroxisomal metabolism and/or functioning has not yet been established. Previously, a genetic ACBD5 deficiency was identified in three siblings with retinal dystrophy and white matter disease. We identified a pathogenic mutation in ACBD5 in another patient and studied the consequences of the ACBD5 defect in patient material and in ACBD5-deficient HeLa cells to uncover this role. Methods We studied a girl who presented with progressive leukodystrophy, syndromic cleft palate, ataxia and retinal dystrophy. We performed biochemical, cell biological and molecular studies in patient material and in ACBD5-deficient HeLa cells generated by CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing. Results We identified a homozygous deleterious indel mutation in ACBD5, leading to complete loss of ACBD5 protein in the patient. Our studies showed that ACBD5 deficiency leads to accumulation of very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) due to impaired peroxisomal β-oxidation. No effect on pexophagy was found. Conclusions Our investigations strongly suggest that ACBD5 plays an important role in sequestering C26-CoA in the cytosol and thereby facilitates transport into the peroxisome and subsequent β-oxidation. Accordingly, ACBD5 deficiency is a novel single peroxisomal enzyme deficiency caused by impaired VLCFA metabolism, leading to retinal dystrophy and white matter disease.",10.1136/jmedgenet-2016-104132
ACBD5,HGNC:23338,acyl-CoA binding domain containing protein 5 deficiency,MONDO:0100112,"Deficiency of a Retinal Dystrophy Protein, Acyl-CoA Binding Domain-containing 5 (ACBD5), Impairs Peroxisomal β-Oxidation of Very-long-chain Fatty Acids*","Acyl-CoA binding domain-containing 5 (ACBD5) is a peroxisomal protein that carries an acyl-CoA binding domain (ACBD) at its N-terminal region. The recent identification of a mutation in the ACBD5 gene in patients with a syndromic form of retinal dystrophy highlights the physiological importance of ACBD5 in humans. However, the underlying pathogenic mechanisms and the precise function of ACBD5 remain unclear. We herein report that ACBD5 is a peroxisomal tail-anchored membrane protein exposing its ACBD to the cytosol. Using patient-derived fibroblasts and ACBD5 knock-out HeLa cells generated via genome editing, we demonstrate that ACBD5 deficiency causes a moderate but significant defect in peroxisomal β-oxidation of very-long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) and elevates the level of cellular phospholipids containing VLCFAs without affecting peroxisome biogenesis, including the import of membrane and matrix proteins. Both the N-terminal ACBD and peroxisomal localization of ACBD5 are prerequisite for efficient VLCFA β-oxidation in peroxisomes. Furthermore, ACBD5 preferentially binds very-long-chain fatty acyl-CoAs (VLC-CoAs). Together, these results suggest a direct role of ACBD5 in peroxisomal VLCFA β-oxidation. Based on our findings, we propose that ACBD5 captures VLC-CoAs on the cytosolic side of the peroxisomal membrane so that the transport of VLC-CoAs into peroxisomes and subsequent β-oxidation thereof can proceed efficiently. Our study reclassifies ACBD5-related phenotype as a novel peroxisomal disorder.",10.1074/jbc.M116.760090

The aims of the study were to test mitochondrial localization of ACBD3 in HEK293 and human skin fibroblast (HSF). Moreover, it was identified the impact of mutation in ACBD3 gene in patient´s samples, ACBD3 protein deficiency in HEK293 and HSF cells on biogenesis of OXPHOS complexes and mitochondrial network and ultrastructure, cholesterol distribution and Golgi apparatus structure to elucidate ACBD3 role in the pathogenesis of the patient´s phenotype. In study we confirmed association of ACBD3 with the OMM in HEK293. In contrast, ACBD3 is absent in HSF mitochondria. The stabile depletion of ACBD3 has a mild impact on levels of OXPHOS complexes in HEK293. Transient reduction of ACBD3 in HSF has any impact on mitochondrial network as well as on level of OXPHOS complex however it has marked impact on Golgi apparatus maintenance.",N/A

Paradoxically, however, loss of ACAT1 in bone marrow causes the aggravation of atherosclerosis and the development of severe cutaneous xanthoma in hyperlipidemic mice. Recently, it has been reported that cholesterol crystals activate NLRP3 (NACHT, LRR [leucine-rich repeats], and PYD [pyrin domain] domain-containing protein 3) inflammasomes, thereby contributing to the development of atherosclerosis. The present study aimed to clarify the role of NLRP3 inflammasomes in the worsening of atherosclerosis and cutaneous xanthoma induced by ACAT1 deficiency. Approach and Results— Ldlr-null mice were transplanted with bone marrow from WT (wild type) mice and mice lacking ACAT1, NLRP3, or both. After the 4 types of mice were fed high-cholesterol diets, we compared their atherosclerosis and skin lesions. The mice transplanted with Acat1-null bone marrow developed severe cutaneous xanthoma, which was filled with numerous macrophages and cholesterol clefts and had markedly increased expression of inflammatory cytokines, and increased atherosclerosis. Loss of NLRP3 completely reversed the cutaneous xanthoma, whereas it improved the atherosclerosis only partially. Acat1-null peritoneal macrophages showed enhanced expression of CHOP (C/EBP [CCAAT/enhancer binding protein] homologous protein) and TNF-&agr; (tumor necrosis factor-&agr;) but no evidence of inflammasome activation, after treatment with acetylated LDL (low-density lipoprotein). Conclusions— Elimination of ACAT1 in bone marrow-derived cells aggravates cutaneous xanthoma and atherosclerosis. The development of cutaneous xanthoma is induced mainly via the NLRP3 inflammasome activation.",10.1161/ATVBAHA.118.311648

Herein, we report a patient with ACBD5 deficiency who was diagnosed after a complicated diagnostic process. Case Presentation: A 6-year-old male patient was admitted with complaints of neuromotor regression and visual disturbances. He had spastic paraparesis dominated with axial hypotonic posturing and horizontal nystagmus. His very-long-chain fatty acid levels were within normal ranges with a slightly elevated C26:0/C22:0 ratio. Brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed white matter involvement. Clinical exome sequencing displayed a novel homozygous intronic splice site variant (c.936 + 2T>G) in the ACBD5 (NM_145698.5) gene. Conclusion: With this report, a novel variant in ACBD5 deficiency was described. Macular dystrophy was demonstrated with optical coherence tomography imaging for the first time in the literature in ACBD5 deficiency. In order to contribute to the knowledge about the clinical, biochemical, and genetic spectrum of ACBD5 deficiency, new patients need to be defined. Established Facts ACBD5 deficiency should be included in differential diagnosis of patients with visual impairment, retinal dystrophy, and neuromotor regression. ACBD5 deficiency results in defective peroxisomal beta oxidation of very-long-chain fatty acids. Isolated C26:0/C22:0 elevation may be the only pathologic biochemical finding. The gold standard in diagnosis is the molecular analysis of the ACBD5.",10.1159/000535534

Multiple Acyl-CoA Dehydrogenase Deficiency (MADD) is a congenital rare metabolic disease with broad clinical phenotypes and variable evolution. This inborn error of metabolism is caused by mutations in the ETFA, ETFB or ETFDH genes, which encode for the mitochondrial ETF and ETF:QO proteins. A considerable group of patients has been described to respond positively to riboflavin oral supplementation, which constitutes the prototypic treatment for the pathology.


OBJECTIVES
To report mutations in ETFA, ETFB and ETFDH genes identified in Portuguese patients, correlating, whenever possible, biochemical and clinical outcomes with the effects of mutations on the structure and stability of the affected proteins, to better understand MADD pathogenesis at the molecular level.

MADD patients were identified based on the characteristic urinary profile of organic acids and/or acylcarnitine profiles in blood spots during newborn screening. Genotypic, clinical and biochemical data were collected for all patients. In silico structural analysis was employed using bioinformatic tools carried out in an ETF:QO molecular model for the identified missense mutations.


RESULTS
A survey describing clinical and biochemical features of eight Portuguese MADD patients was made. Genotype analysis identified five ETFDH mutations, including one extension (p.X618QextX*14), two splice mutations (c.34+5G>C and c.405+3A>T) and two missense mutations (ETF:QO-p.Arg155Gly and ETF:QO-p.Pro534Leu), and one ETFB mutation (ETFβ- p.Arg191Cys). Homozygous patients containing the ETFDH mutations p.X618QextX*14, c.34+5G>C and ETF:QO-p.Arg155Gly, all presented severe (lethal) MADD phenotypes. However, when any of these mutations are in heterozygosity with the known ETF:QO-p.Pro534Leu mild variant, the severe clinical effects are partly and temporarily attenuated. Indeed, the latter destabilizes an ETF-interacting loop, with no major functional consequences. However, the position 155 in ETF:QO is localized at the ubiquinone binding and membrane interacting domain, and is thus expected to perturb protein structure and membrane insertion, with severe functional effects. Structural analysis of molecular models is therefore demonstrated to be a valuable tool to rationalize the effects of mutations in the context of the clinical phenotype severity.


CONCLUSION
Advanced molecular diagnosis, structural analysis and clinical correlations reveal that MADD patients harboring a severe prognosis mutation in one allele can actually revert to a milder phenotype by complementation with a milder mutation in the other allele. However, such patients are nevertheless in a precarious metabolic balance which can revert to severe fatal outcomes during catabolic stress or secondary pathology, thus requiring strict clinical follow-up.",10.2174/1566524019666190507114748
ACBD5,HGNC:23338,acyl-CoA binding domain containing protein 5 deficiency,MONDO:0100112,Ataxia with giant axonopathy in Acbd5-deficient mice halted by adeno-associated virus gene therapy.,"Acyl-CoA binding domain containing 5 (ACBD5) is a critical player in handling very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA) on route for peroxisomal β-oxidation. Mutations in ACBD5 lead to the accumulation of VLCFA, and patients present retinal dystrophy, ataxia, psychomotor delay, and a severe leukodystrophy. Using CRISPR/Cas9, we generated and characterized an Acbd5 Gly357* mutant allele. Gly357* mutant mice recapitulated key features of the human disorder, including reduced survival, impaired locomotion and reflexes, loss of photoreceptors, and demyelination. The ataxic presentation of Gly357* mice involved the loss of cerebellar Purkinje cells and a giant axonopathy throughout the central nervous system. Lipidomic studies provided evidence for the extensive lipid dysregulation caused by VLCFA accumulation. Following a proteomic survey, functional studies in neurons treated with VLCFA unraveled a deregulated cytoskeleton with reduced actin dynamics and increased neuronal filopodia. We also show that an adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated gene delivery ameliorated the gait phenotypes and the giant axonopathy, also improving myelination and astrocyte reactivity. Collectively, we established a mouse model with significance for VLCFA-related disorders. The development of relevant neuropathological outcomes enabled the understanding of mechanisms modulated by VLCFA and the evaluation of the efficacy of preclinical therapeutic interventions.",10.1093/brain/awad407

For genetic diseases, predictive test results are commonly straightforward: presence of the mutation involves increased risk for disease and absence of the mutation involves no inherit risk for disease. Germline mutations in telomere‐related genes (TRGs) can lead to telomere shortening and are associated with short telomere syndrome (STS). Telomere length is heritable, and in families with STS due to a TRG mutation, progeny with and without the TRG mutation is known to have shorter than average telomeres. We hypothesize that progeny of TRG mutation carriers who did not inherit the TRG mutation may still develop pulmonary fibrosis.",10.1111/resp.14145

He was found to have a macrocytic anaemia, thrombocytopenia and circulating blasts (9%). The bone marrow aspirate was hypercellular with increased blast cells (37%) in a background of trilineage dysplasia. The blasts were large and pleomorphic, with highly atypical morphology, including cells with large, pleomorphic nuclei, prominent nucleoli and abundant vacuolated cytoplasm, as well as binucleate forms (left). The blasts were positive for myeloperoxidase (small subset) and negative for nonspecific esterase by cytochemical staining and, by flow cytometry, positive for CD45 (weak), CD34, HLA-DR, myeloid markers CD13, CD33, CD117, CD15 (subset), CD64 (small subset), CD11b (small subset), CD123 and the T-cell marker CD7, but negative for CD56 and other myeloid, monocytic, B-cell and T-cell markers. The bone marrow core biopsy sections showed extensive (60–70%) marrow involvement by CD34-positive blasts with background trilineage dysplasia (right). Cytogenetic analysis showed: 47,XY,-4,add(5)(q11 2),-7,del(8) (p11 2),i(9)(p10),+11,add(12)(p11 2),+21,+22[cp20].nuc ish (D5S723/D5S721x2,EGR1x1)[98/100],(D7Z1,D7S486)x1[91/ 100]. Next generation sequencing-based molecular studies showed loss of genes on 4q, 7p, 7q and 12p, and a pathogenic TP53 D281V point mutation with an allele frequency of 90 5%, increased from 4 1% at a prior analysis. A diagnosis of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) with myelodysplasia-related changes (AML-MRC) was made. Because of the dismal prognosis, the patient elected to receive palliative care and expired two weeks later. Short telomere syndromes, including dyskeratosis congenita, are genetic disorders caused by mutations in genes encoding components of the telomerase holoenzyme, including TERC, TERT and DKC1. They have diverse clinical manifestations, including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, which typically occurs in adults in the fifth decade of life. Affected individuals are at increased risk of developing bone marrow failure and liver disease, as well as haematological malignancies, such as myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and AML, which may be due to telomere defects leading to genomic instability, immunodeficiency and failure of cancer immunosurveillance, and/or a state of organ failure, such as aplastic anaemia. In this case, the patient developed de novo AML-MRC, including MDS-related cytogenetic abnormalities and highly atypical myeloblasts.",10.1111/bjh.15505
ACD,HGNC:25070,ACD-related short telomere syndrome,MONDO:0100569,Familial Clonal Hematopoiesis in a Long Telomere Syndrome.,"BACKGROUND
Telomere shortening is a well-characterized cellular aging mechanism, and short telomere syndromes cause age-related disease. However, whether long telomere length is advantageous is poorly understood.


METHODS
We examined the clinical and molecular features of aging and cancer in persons carrying heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in the telomere-related gene POT1 and noncarrier relatives.


RESULTS
A total of 17 POT1 mutation carriers and 21 noncarrier relatives were initially included in the study, and a validation cohort of 6 additional mutation carriers was subsequently recruited. A majority of the POT1 mutation carriers with telomere length evaluated (9 of 13) had long telomeres (>99th percentile). POT1 mutation carriers had a range of benign and malignant neoplasms involving epithelial, mesenchymal, and neuronal tissues in addition to B- and T-cell lymphoma and myeloid cancers. Five of 18 POT1 mutation carriers (28%) had T-cell clonality, and 8 of 12 (67%) had clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential. A predisposition to clonal hematopoiesis had an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance, as well as penetrance that increased with age; somatic DNMT3A and JAK2 hotspot mutations were common. These and other somatic driver mutations probably arose in the first decades of life, and their lineages secondarily accumulated a higher mutation burden characterized by a clocklike signature. Successive generations showed genetic anticipation (i.e., an increasingly early onset of disease). In contrast to noncarrier relatives, who had the typical telomere shortening with age, POT1 mutation carriers maintained telomere length over the course of 2 years.


CONCLUSIONS
POT1 mutations associated with long telomere length conferred a predisposition to a familial clonal hematopoiesis syndrome that was associated with a range of benign and malignant solid neoplasms. The risk of these phenotypes was mediated by extended cellular longevity and by the capacity to maintain telomeres over time.

ACD,HGNC:25070,ACD-related short telomere syndrome,MONDO:0100569,Short Telomere Length Predicts Non-Relapse Mortality after Stem Cell Transplantation for Myelodysplastic Syndrome.,"Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is the only potentially curative treatment for patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), but long-term survival is limited by the risk of transplant-related complications. Short telomere length, mediated by inherited or acquired factors, impairs cellular response to genotoxic and replicative stress and could identify patients at higher risk for toxicity after transplantation. We measured relative telomere length in pre-transplant recipient blood samples in 1514 MDS patients and evaluated the association of telomere length with MDS disease characteristics and transplantation outcomes. Shorter telomere length was significantly associated with older age, male sex, somatic mutations that impair the DNA damage response, and more severe pre-transplant cytopenias, but not with bone marrow blast count, MDS treatment history, or history of prior cancer therapy. Among 1267 patients ≥40 years old, telomere length in the shortest quartile was associated with inferior survival (p<0.001) due to a high risk of non-relapse mortality (p=0.001) after adjusting for significant clinical and genetic variables. The adverse impact of shorter telomeres on NRM was independent of recipient comorbidities and was observed selectively among patients receiving more intensive conditioning, including myeloablative regimens and higher-dose melphalan-based reduced-intensity regimens. The effect of shorter telomeres on NRM was prominent among patients who developed severe acute graft-versus-host disease, suggesting that short telomere length may limit regenerative potential of mucosal tissues after acute injury. MDS patients with shorter telomere length, who have inferior survival driven by excess toxicity, could be considered for strategies focused on minimizing toxic effects of transplantation.",10.1182/blood.2020005397

 Background: Molecular genetic alterations and short telomere length have reported as affect clinical outcome of patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Recently, gene mutation was suggested as a new variable in new developed prognostic scoring model integrated IPSS-R. In addition, shorted telomere length reflected the genetic instability and closely associated various clinical fatal conditions. Here we proposed a new scoring system that encompass gene variations, telomere lengths and IPSS-R together.
 Methods: In 153 patients diagnosed with MDS in Seoul National University Hospital, G-banding, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), targeted capture sequencing for 88 hematopoiesis-related genes, and measurement of telomere length (TL) were performed. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis with the log-rank test and Cox proportional hazards regression analysis were used to develop a new prognostic system using Mathematica.
 Results: A total of 378 candidate mutations in 72 genes were found. Mutation of TP53, ASXL1, EZH2 showed significant correlation with adverse prognosis among 12 genes with frequency over 5% or more (ASXL1, U2AF1, TP53, RUNX1, TET2, DNMT3A, SRSF2, BCOR, EZH2, SF3B1, STAG2, and WT1). Patients with telomere length <5.37 showed an adverse survival. We developed a new scoring model incorporating the weighted coefficients of these variables: Age x 0.017 + IPSS-R score x 0.220 + ASXL1 mutation x 0.406 + TP53 mutation x 0.897 + EZH2 mutation x 0.706 + Telomere length (less than 5.37) x 0.548. The age and IPSS-R score were used as a continuous variable. The presence of gene mutations and TL below 5.37 was scored as 1. According to this new scoring system, patients were divided into four groups: low score cutoff (<1.5, n=16), intermediate-1 (1.5-2.0, n=27), intermediate-2 (2.0-2.5, n=39), high (≥2.5, n=45). The median OS was 150, 73, 67 and 36 months for low, intermediate-1, intermediate-2, and high, retrospectively (p<0.001). Meanwhile, according to conventional IPSS-R scoring system, the median OS was 97, 78, 79, 63, and 34 months for very low, low, intermediate, high and very high, retrospectively (p <0.001). The mutation of ASXL1, TP53, EZH2, RUNX1, SFSR2 and STAG2 were observed more frequency in intermediated-2 and high risk group in new scoring model. The C-index increased in new scoring models (0.79) compared with the existing IPSS-R (0.69). In addition, we assessed new scoring model excluding telomere length. The score cut off was slightly changed in low score cutoff (<1.7, n=29), intermediate-1 (1.7-2.0, n=50), intermediate-2 (2.2-2.7, n=34), high (≥2.5, n=40). The C-index was 0.78 in this model.
 Conclusion: We proposed new model combined TL, molecular variations integrated existing IPSS-R. This new model showed more informative prognostic ability than existing IPSS-R. And short telomere length makes new molecular scoring system a powerful prognostic model.

They shorten with successive cell divisions leading to eventual senescence [3]. Short telomere length has been found in several disorders, including dyskeratosis congenita (DKC) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Presentation time of short telomere syndromes ranges from early childhood to adulthood with some evidence of genetic anticipation [4]. Dyskeratosis congenita, a bone marrow failure syndrome characterized by short telomeres, has never been associated with autoimmune neutropenia (AIN). Here, we report our experience on coexisting AIN and short telomeres in two children. Case 1. A female patient presented with severe neutropenia (0.1 × 109/L) at 1 year of age without history of frequent or serious infections. Family history was negative for neutropenia. She tested positive for anti-neutrophil antibodies at different times consistent with AIN. There are no dysplastic nails or persistent oral leukoplakia. As part of initial work-up, telomere length analysis was performed and showed short telomeres (<1%) in both granulocytes and lymphocytes. Her parents do not have short telomeres. A variant of unknown significance (VUS) in DKC-related DKC1 was detected in a gene panel for inborn errors of immunity and later, a VUS in ACD detected in whole exome sequencing (WES). Bone marrow biopsy showed 90% cellularity and trilineage hematopoiesis with prominent neutrophil hemophagocytosis. Case 2. A female patientwith positive antineutrophil antibodies and so far, a benign coursewithout infections presentedwith neutrophils of 0.3 × 109/L at 3 years of age.

ACD,HGNC:25070,ACD-related short telomere syndrome,MONDO:0100569,The association of metabolic syndrome with telomere length as a marker of cellular aging: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background It has been suggested that metabolic syndrome (MetS) accelerates the aging process, potentially contributing to the development of age-related complications. Available studies examining the relation of MetS to telomere length (TL), a putative biological marker of aging, have yielded inconclusive findings. This meta-analysis was performed to investigate the association between MetS and TL. Methods A comprehensive systematic search was conducted in PubMed and Scopus databases to identify relevant literature published up to February 2024. Standard mean difference (SMD) and standardized beta coefficient (β) with their 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used as effect sizes to measure the associations using the random effects model. Results A total of nine studies, comprising a total sample size of 8,606 participants, were eligible for the meta-analysis. No significant difference in mean TL was found between patients with and without MetS (SMD = −0.03, 95%CI = −0.17 to 0.10), with a significant heterogeneity across the studies (I 2 = 89.7.0%, p ≤ 0.001). In contrast, it was revealed that MetS is negatively related to TL (β = −0.08, 95%CI = −0.15 to −0.004). In the subgroup analysis, this finding was supported by the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) definition of MetS. Conclusion This meta-analysis highlighted that MetS may be linked to a shorter TL. Additional studies are required to confirm this finding.",10.3389/fgene.2024.1390198
ACD,HGNC:25070,ACD-related short telomere syndrome,MONDO:0100569,Bone Marrow Failure Associated with Short Telomeres and Digenic Variants of Uncertain Significance in Telomere Biology Genes,"
 Telomere Biology Disorders (TBD) are a group of heritable disorders characterized by abnormally short telomeres. There are at least 15 genes associated with TBD including ACD, CTC1, DKC1, NHP2, NOP10, PARN, POT1, RTEL1, STN1, TERC, TERT, TINF2, WRAP53 NAF1 and ZCCHC8, which can be inherited in autosomal dominant (AD), autosomal recessive (AR), or X-linked recessive patterns. Genetic anticipation has been described in some families with more severe symptoms appearing in each successive generation. We report two patients that presented with bone marrow failure, who were subsequently identified to have short telomeres and variants of uncertain significance (VUS) in two different telomere genes inherited from their parents. These cases suggest a potential for digenic inheritance of TBD.
 CASE 1:
 At age 6, patient was diagnosed with stage 4 neuroblastoma. He was treated with chemotherapy, surgery, immunotherapy, and autologous stem cell rescue. At age 10, he developed frequent and severe epistaxis and was found to have pancytopenia. He underwent a bone marrow aspirate and biopsy which revealed a hypocellular marrow and der (1;7), which is associated with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).
 Genetic evaluation revealed one pathogenic variant in DNAJC21 (from father) and VUS in NAF1 (c.1375C>T) (from father) and RTEL1 (c.533T>C) (from mother). Because NAF1 and RTEL1 are related to AD or AR TBD, telomere length testing was performed. Patient was found to have low telomere length, < 1st percentile, in granulocytes, lymphocytes, memory T cells and NK cells (Figure 1). The patient's mother was found to have borderline low telomere length >=1 and <10 th percentiles in her lymphocytes, naïve T cells, memory T cells, and B cells, and low telomere length in her granulocytes. Father had borderline low telomere length >=1 and <10 th percentiles in granulocytes but normal telomere length in all other subsets. Neither parent reported any symptoms that would be consistent with TBD. We interpreted these findings as consistent with the patient having TBD and the patient's mother either also having TBD or being a carrier, and the potential that genetic anticipation may be involved. The NAF1 variant appears likely to be benign as father's telomeres were normal in length except for low telomere length in his granulocyte compartment. It is possible that the patient's prior treatment for neuroblastoma may have contributed to the shortened telomeres.
 Over the course of a year, patient developed worsening bone marrow failure. He then underwent reduced intensity conditioning using busulfan, fludarabine and anti-thymocyte globulin for a 4/6 matched cord stem cell transplant. He engrafted on day +10.
 CASE 2:
 A 15-year-old male presented with a depressed skull fracture and scalp hematoma following a sports-related head injury. He was incidentally found to have a platelet count of 69 x 10 3/microliter, mild anemia with macrocytosis, and mild leukopenia. Bone marrow biopsy revealed a hypocellular marrow with multilineage maturation, mild fibrosis, and no cytogenetic abnormalities.
 The patient's telomere lengths were low, below the 1 st percentile, in all 6 white blood cell subsets (Figure 2). He underwent clinical trio exome sequencing along with his parents. He was found to have VUSs in TERT (c.3158-80G>A) (from mother), TINF2 (c.814T>C) (from mother) and SRP72 (c.1928C>T) (from father). Mother was also found to have low telomere length (<1 st percentile) in all 6 subsets. Both parents have normal blood counts while patient continues to have pancytopenia and is transfusion independent. It is presently unclear which of the VUSs are contributing to the patient's phenotype as the TERT and TINF2 variants are both associated with bone marrow failure and heterozygous germline variants in SRP72 is associated with familial MDS.
 Genes that cause TBD can be inherited through various modes of inheritance. These two patients who presented with bone marrow failure, identified to have VUSs in more than one TBD-associated genes and functional evidence of shortened telomeres, highlight the potential for a digenic mode of inheritance underlying TBD. Synergy between two variants contributes to a penetrant phenotype and can result in earlier or more severe onset of disease. Our patients' parents were asymptomatic or mildly affected, compared to our patients. Larger cohort studies are needed to determine the prevalence of this mode of inheritance.",10.1182/blood-2023-177530

We report a Chinese girl with novel compound heterozygous variants in ACO2, who presented at 7 months of age with psychomotor retardation, truncal hypotonia, and ophthalmologic abnormalities. This study aims to investigate the potential molecular mechanisms underlying ACO2 deficiency-induced neuropathy. Methods Whole exome sequencing was performed on family members to screen for potential pathogenic mutations, followed by Sanger sequencing for validation. Mitochondrial aconitase activity and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number were measured using an aconitase activity detection kit and quantitative PCR, respectively. Transcriptome expression profiles from patient cells, and cerebellar and retinal organoids retrieved from the GEO database were integrated. Functional enrichment analysis and protein-protein interaction networks were used to identify key molecules, and their expression levels were validated using Western blot analysis. Results Genetic testing revealed novel compound heterozygous variations in the proband's ACO2 gene (NM:001098), including c.854A>G (p.Asn285Ser) and c.1183C>T (p.Arg395Cys). Predictive analysis of the tertiary structure of the ACO2 protein suggests that both p.Asn285Ser and p.Arg395Cys affect the binding ability of ACO2 to ligands. The mitochondrial aconitase activity and mtDNA copy number in the proband's leukocytes were significantly reduced. Transcriptomic data analysis identified 80 key candidate genes involved in ACO2-related neuropathy. Among these, LRP8 and ANK3, whose gene expression levels were significantly positively correlated with ACO2, were further validated by Western blot analysis. Conclusions This study expands the spectrum of pathogenic ACO2 variants, elucidates the potential molecular mechanisms underlying ACO2-related neuropathy, provides in-depth support for the pathogenicity of ACO2 genetic variations, and offers new insights into the pathogenesis of ICRD.",10.3389/fncel.2024.1492048

Proteomic and western blot analyses revealed that DAU treatment mainly modified the expression of proteins involved in mitochondrial energy metabolism, such as Aco2, Ndufs1, Cox5a, and SDHB, and that of synapse-related proteins such as Syn1 and Syn2. Pathway analysis revealed that DAU modulated the tricarboxylic acid cycle, synaptic vesicle cycle, glycolysis, and gluconeogenesis in 3xTg-AD mice.

ACO2,HGNC:118,mitochondrial disease,MONDO:0044970,Lymphocytic mitochondrial aconitase activity is reduced in Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment.,"BACKGROUND
Specific mechanisms behind the role of oxidative/nitrosative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis remain elusive. Mitochondrial aconitase (ACO2) is a Krebs cycle enzyme sensitive to free radical-mediated damage.


OBJECTIVE
We assessed activity and expression of ACO2 extracted from blood lymphocytes of subjects with AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), older adults with normal cognition (OCN, age ≥65 years), and younger adults with normal cognition (YCN, age <65 years). Plasma levels and activities of antioxidants were also measured.


METHODS
Blood samples were collected from 28 subjects with AD, 22 with MCI, 21 OCN, and 19 YCN. ACO2 activity was evaluated in a subsample before and after in vitro exposure to free radicals.


RESULTS
ACO2 activity was significantly lower in AD and MCI cases than controls: ACO2 median activity was 0.64 ± 0.21 U/mg protein for AD, 0.93 ± 0.28 U/mg protein for MCI, 1.17 ± 0.78 U/mg protein for OCN subjects, and 1.23 ± 0.43 U/mg protein for YCN individuals. In subjects with AD and MCI, ACO2 expression was lower than OCN subjects, and ACO2 activity correlated with vitamin E plasma levels (rho: 0.64, p < 0.001) and Mini-Mental State Examination total score (rho: 0.82, p < 0.001). Furthermore, free radicals exposure reduced ACO2 activity more in individuals with AD than in OCN subjects.


CONCLUSION
Our results suggest that ACO2 activity is reduced in peripheral lymphocytes of subjects with AD and MCI and correlates with antioxidant protection. Further studies are warranted to verify the role of ACO2 in AD pathogenesis and its importance as a marker of AD progression.",10.3233/JAD-142052

Most patients remain nonambulatory and do no acquire any language, but a subgroup of patients share a more favorable course. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is typically normal within the first months but global atrophy gradually develops affecting predominantly the cerebellum. Ten of our patients were homozygous to the previously reported c.336C>G founder mutation while the other six patients were all compound heterozygotes displaying 10 novel mutations of whom 2 were nonsense predicting a deleterious effect on enzyme function. Structural protein modeling predicted significant impairment in aconitase substrate binding in the additional missense mutations. This study provides the most extensive cohort of patients and further delineates the clinical, radiological, biochemical, and molecular features of ACO2 deficiency.",10.1002/jimd.12022

Mitochondrial aconitase (ACO2) is a nuclear‐encoded tricarboxylic acid cycle enzyme. Homozygous pathogenic missense variants in the ACO2 gene were initially associated with infantile degeneration of the cerebrum, cerebellum, and retina, resulting in profound intellectual and developmental disability and early death. Subsequent studies have identified a range of homozygous and compound heterozygous pathogenic missense, nonsense, frameshift, and splice‐site ACO2 variants in patients with a spectrum of clinical manifestations and disease severities.",10.1002/acn3.51074

Methods Clinical, genetic, and functional analyses involving genome-wide linkage coupled to whole-exome sequencing in a consanguineous family with complicated HSP. Results A homozygous missense mutation was identified in the ACO2 gene (c.1240T>G p.Phe414Val) that segregated with HSP complicated by intellectual disability and microcephaly. Lymphoblastoid cell lines of homozygous carrier patients revealed significantly decreased activity of the mitochondrial aconitase enzyme and defective mitochondrial respiration. ACO2 encodes mitochondrial aconitase, an essential enzyme in the Krebs cycle. Recessive mutations in this gene have been previously associated with cerebellar ataxia.

Previously, we identified several up- and down-regulated protein molecules in the striatum of the Hdh(CAG)150 knock-in mice at 16 months of age, a mouse model which is modeling the early human HD stage. Among those molecules, aconitase 2 (Aco2) located in the mitochondrial matrix is involved in the energy generation and susceptible to increased oxidative stress that would lead to inactivation of Aco2 activity. In this study, we demonstrate decreased Aco2 protein level and activity in the brain of both Hdh(CAG)150 and R6/2 mice. Aco2 activity was decreased in striatum of Hdh(CAG)150 mice at 16 months of age as well as R6/2 mice at 7 to 13 weeks of age. Aco2 activity in the striatum of R6/2 mice could be restored by the anti-oxidant, N-acetyl-l-cysteine, supporting that decreased Aco2 activity in HD is probably caused by increased oxidative damage. Decreased Aco2 activity was further found in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of both HD patients and pre-symptomatic HD mutation (PreHD) carriers, while the decreased Aco2 protein level of PBMC was only present in HD patients. Aco2 activity correlated significantly with motor score, independence scale, and functional capacity of the Unified Huntington’s Disease Rating Scale as well as disease duration. Our study provides a potential biomarker to assess the disease status of HD patients and PreHD carriers.",10.3390/ijms18112480

Only eight cases of MITCH have been reported. While all these patients experienced cutaneous abnormalities, detailed skin features and potential treatment have not been documented. Herein, we report two MITCH patients who harbored a de novo heterozygous variant p.Asn237Ser in ACOX1 and experienced progressive ichthyosiform erythroderma. Skin histopathology revealed hyperkeratosis and parakeratosis with focal hypogranulosis as well as dyskeratotic keratinocytes. Lipid accumulation in the epidermis was observed using Oil Red O staining. Both patients exhibited a remarkable response to treatment with the topical antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC), with Patient 1 achieving complete recovery after 3 months of consistent treatment.

ACOX1,HGNC:119,Mitchell syndrome,MONDO:0030073,Generation and characterization of a zebrafish gain-of-function ACOX1 Mitchell disease model,"Background Mitchell syndrome is a rare, neurodegenerative disease caused by an ACOX1 gain-of-function mutation (c.710A>G; p.N237S), with fewer than 20 reported cases. Affected patients present with leukodystrophy, seizures, and hearing loss. ACOX1 serves as the rate-limiting enzyme in peroxisomal beta-oxidation of very long-chain fatty acids. The N237S substitution has been shown to stabilize the active ACOX1 dimer, resulting in dysregulated enzymatic activity, increased oxidative stress, and glial damage. Mitchell syndrome lacks a vertebrate model, limiting insights into the pathophysiology of ACOX1-driven white matter damage and neuroinflammatory insults. Methods We report a patient presenting with rapidly progressive white matter damage and neurological decline, who was eventually diagnosed with an ACOX1 N237S mutation through whole genome sequencing. We developed a zebrafish model of Mitchell syndrome using transient ubiquitous overexpression of the human ACOX1 N237S variant tagged with GFP. We assayed zebrafish behavior, oligodendrocyte numbers, expression of white matter and inflammatory transcripts, and analysis of peroxisome counts. Results The patient experienced progressive leukodystrophy and died 2 years after presentation. The transgenic zebrafish showed a decreased swimming ability, which was restored with the reactive microglia-targeted antioxidant dendrimer-N-acetyl-cysteine conjugate. The mutants showed no effect on oligodendrocyte counts but did display activation of the integrated stress response (ISR). Using a novel SKL-targeted mCherry reporter, we found that mutants had reduced density of peroxisomes. Conclusions We developed a vertebrate (zebrafish) model of Mitchell syndrome using transient ubiquitous overexpression of the human ACOX1 N237S variant. The transgenic mutants exhibited motor impairment and showed signs of activated ISR, but interestingly, there were no changes in oligodendrocyte counts. However, the mutants exhibited a deficiency in the number of peroxisomes, suggesting a possible shared mechanism with the Zellweger spectrum disorders.",10.3389/fped.2024.1326886

So far, only five patients with this disease have been described worldwide. We present here two additional unrelated German patients found to carry the same heterozygous ACOX1  N237S variant through exome sequencing (ES). Both patients showed neurodegenerative clinical features starting from ∼4 to 5 years of age including progressive hearing loss, ataxia, ichthyosis, as well as progressive visual impairment leading to amaurosis, and died at the ages of 16 and 8 years, respectively. The first patient was clinically suspected to have anti–myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein-antibody-associated myelitis, but the disease course overall deteriorated despite extensive immunomodulatory therapy. The second patient was originally suspected to have a mitochondrial disorder due to intermittent elevated blood lactate. Since Mitchell syndrome has only been identified in 2020, the diagnosis in this second patient was only established through re-evaluation of ES data years after the original analysis. Comparison of all seven reported patients suggests that Mitchell syndrome often (but not always) clinically mimics autoimmune-inflammatory disease. Therefore, in patients with autoimmune central nervous system disease who do not respond adequately to standard therapies, re-evaluation of this diagnosis is needed and genetic analyses such as trio ES should be considered.",10.1055/s-0043-1776013

These symptoms are usually mild and somatic and often subside during or just before the start of menstruation. Medical professionals employ pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments as the primary approach to managing PMS. One effective non-pharmacological method is Laura Mitchell's physiological relaxation treatment, which has been shown to enhance immunological function, reduce depression, and improve the overall quality of life. Another beneficial technique is Benson's relaxation technique, established by Herbert Benson in 1970, providing a simple yet powerful stress-release strategy. For this study, research papers were searched using various reputable databases such as PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar websites, with data collected up to the end of 2021. The publication dates of the review articles were not restricted, allowing for a comprehensive overview. However, it is important to note that only a limited number of accessible studies have been found, underscoring the need for further research.

To determine why MRS patients specifically lack pancreatic endocrine cells, we micro-CT imaged a 12-week old foetus homozygous for the nonsense mutation RFX6 c.1129C>T, which revealed loss of the pancreas body and tail. From this foetus, we derived iPSC and show that differentiation of these cells in vitro proceeds normally until generation of pancreatic endoderm, which is significantly reduced. We additionally generated an RFX6 HA reporter allele by gene targeting in wild-type H9 cells to precisely define RFX6 expression and in parallel performed in situ hybridization for RFX6 in the dorsal pancreatic bud of a Carnegie Stage 14 human embryo. Both in vitro and in vivo, we find that RFX6 specifically labels a subset of PDX1-expressing pancreatic endoderm. In summary, RFX6 is essential for efficient differentiation of pancreatic endoderm, and its absence in MRS patients specifically impairs formation of endocrine cells of the pancreas head and tail.",10.1242/dev.194878

Mitchell Riley syndrome (MRS) due to RFX6 gene mutations is characterized by neonatal diabetes and protracted diarrhea. RFX6 gene encodes a transcription factor involved in enteroendocrine cell differentiation required for beta-cell maturation. In contrast to the pathway by which RFX6 mutations leads to diabetes, the mechanisms underlying protracted diarrhea are unknown.


OBJECTIVES
To assess whether glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) was involved in the pathogenesis of MRS protracted diarrhea.


DESIGN
Two case report descriptions.


SETTING
Tertiary pediatric hospital.


INTERVENTION
""Off-label"" treatment with liraglutide.


PATIENTS
We report two children diagnosed with MRS, presenting neonatal diabetes and protracted diarrhea. Both patients had nearly undetectable GLP-1 plasma levels and absence of GLP-1 immunostaining in distal intestine and rectum.


MAIN OUTCOME
To evaluate whether GLP-1 analogue therapy could improve MRS protracted diarrhea.


RESULTS
""Off-label"" liraglutide treatment, licensed for type 2 diabetes treatment in children, was started as rescue therapy for protracted intractable diarrhea resulting in rapid improvement during the course of 12 months.


CONCLUSIONS
Congenital GLP-1 deficiency was identified in patients with MRS. The favorable response to liraglutide further supports GLP-1 involvement in the pathogenesis of protracted diarrhea and its potential therapeutic use.",10.1210/clinem/dgaa916

The primary aim of this systematic review and meta‐analysis was to assess the prevalence of MetS and its components in people with schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders, bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder, comparing subjects with different disorders and taking into account demographic variables and psychotropic medication use. The secondary aim was to compare the MetS prevalence in persons with any of the selected disorders versus matched general population controls. The pooled MetS prevalence in people with severe mental illness was 32.6% (95% CI: 30.8%‐34.4%; N = 198; n = 52,678). Relative risk meta‐analyses established that there was no significant difference in MetS prevalence in studies directly comparing schizophrenia versus bipolar disorder, and in those directly comparing bipolar disorder versus major depressive disorder. Only two studies directly compared people with schizophrenia and major depressive disorder, precluding meta‐analytic calculations. Older age and a higher body mass index were significant moderators in the final demographic regression model (z = −3.6, p = 0.0003, r2 = 0.19). People treated with all individual antipsychotic medications had a significantly (p<0.001) higher MetS risk compared to antipsychotic‐naïve participants. MetS risk was significantly higher with clozapine and olanzapine (except vs. clozapine) than other antipsychotics, and significantly lower with aripiprazole than other antipsychotics (except vs. amisulpride). Compared with matched general population controls, people with severe mental illness had a significantly increased risk for MetS (RR = 1.58; 95% CI: 1.35‐1.86; p<0.001) and all its components, except for hypertension (p = 0.07). These data suggest that the risk for MetS is similarly elevated in the diagnostic subgroups of severe mental illness. Routine screening and multidisciplinary management of medical and behavioral conditions is needed in these patients. Risks of individual antipsychotics should be considered when making treatment choices.",10.1002/wps.20252
ACOX2,HGNC:120,congenital bile acid synthesis defect 6,MONDO:0015015,Clinical and genetic features of congenital bile acid synthesis defect with a novel mutation in AKR1D1 gene sequencing,"Abstract Rationale: Congenital bile acid synthesis defect (BASD) is a rare disease caused by mutations in the aldo-keto reductase 1D1 gene, which encodes the primary Δ4-3-oxosteroid 5β-reductase enzyme. Early disease diagnosis is critical for early treatment with bile acid replacement therapy, with an excellent chance for recovery. In contrast, protracted diagnosis and treatment may lead to poor outcomes, including decompensated hepatic cirrhosis, liver transplant, and even death. Patient concerns: Three clinical congenital bile acid synthesis defect cases in the Vietnamese population are herein reported. These pediatric patients presented with symptoms of prolonged postpartum jaundice and abnormal loose stool (mucus, lipids, and white). The clinical examinations showed hepatosplenomegaly. Urinalysis showed a very low fraction of primary bile acids and atypical 3-oxo-Δ4- bile acids in all three patients. Diagnoses: The patients were diagnosed with primary Δ4-3-oxosteroid 5β-reductase deficiency. Next-generation gene sequencing revealed two homozygous mutations in the aldo-keto reductase family 1 member D1 gene. The first is a documented variant, c.797G>A (p.Arg266Gln), and the second is a novel mutation at c.155T>C (p.Ile52Thr). Interventions: Immediately after diagnosis, patients were treated with oral chenodeoxycholate 5 mg/kg/d. Outcomes: The patients’ symptoms, signs, and primary bile acids levels improved significantly. Lessons: Clinicians should consider genetic disorders related to cholestasis for effective and life-saving treatment. A prompt genetic analysis by next-generation gene sequencing enables patients to access bile acid replacement therapy earlier, significantly improving short- and long-term outcomes.",10.1097/MD.0000000000029476

ACP5,HGNC:124,Spondyloenchondrodysplasia with immune dysregulation,MONDO:0011939,A rare case of late-onset spondyloenchondrodysplasia with immune dysregulation presenting as adult-onset monogenic lupus.,"BACKGROUND
Spondyloenchondrodysplasia is classified as an interferonopathy resulting from recessive mutations in the ACP5 gene and manifests with various clinical features, including distinctive skeletal dysplasia, neurological abnormalities, immune dysfunction resembling systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and Sjogren's syndrome. While SLE is typically considered multifactorial and more prevalent in adulthood, a subset of approximately 10%-25% of childhood cases arise from monogenic form. Among these, spondyloenchondrodysplasia accounts for only a rare fraction of monogenic lupus cases, with only 22 reported instances in the literature.


CASE REPORT
This paper presents a new case of spondyloenchondrodysplasia-immune dysregulation (SPENCDI) in an adult patient born to nonconsanguineous parents. The patient was diagnosed with SPENCDI and exhibited immune neutropenia, anti-dsDNA positivity, platyspondyly, immune deficiency, and a homozygous variant (c.155 A > C, p. Lys52Thr) in the ACP5 gene, previously classified as pathogenic. Notably, the patient achieved successful clinical management through the initiation of baricitinib treatment, a Janus kinase inhibitor.


CONCLUSION
SPENCDI represents an uncommon cause of SLE in adulthood. Clinicians should be vigilant of underlying Mendelian inheritance when encountering patients with associated features. While treatments for both Mendelian and non-Mendelian SLE are similar, Janus kinase inhibitors like baricitinib show potential for managing interferon-signature monogenic SLE cases.",10.1177/09612033241301506

ACP5,HGNC:124,Spondyloenchondrodysplasia with immune dysregulation,MONDO:0011939,A Case of Familial Spondyloenchondrodysplasia with Immune Dysregulation Masquerading as Moyamoya Syndrome,"Dear Editor, Spondyloenchondrodysplasia with immune dysregulation (SPENCDI; OMIM#607944) caused by ACP5 mutations is a rare skeletal dysplasia that was originally described with radiolucent spondylar and metaphyseal lesions.1 Neurological involvement—including spasticity, developmental delay, intracranial calcification, and leukodystrophy—has subsequently been reported.2,3 Moreover, immune dysregulations such as autoimmunity or immune deficiencies have also been documented.4 Systemic lupus erythematous (SLE) is also reportedly associated with SPENCDI.3 Here we report two siblings with ACP5 variants presenting with moyamoya syndrome (MMS) that progressed to SLE. A 3-year-old boy was admitted for recurrent transient ischemic attacks of monoplegia or hemiplegia on the right or left side, which usually improved within a few hours. Brain MRI and angiography revealed bilateral middle and anterior cerebral arterial stenoses with collateral circulation (Fig. 1A). His developmental milestones were within the normal range for age. No skin rash, oral lesions, or arthritis were noted. The findings of laboratory studies including an immunological workup were normal. He underwent left encephalogaleoperiosteal synangiosis with encephaloduroarteriosynangiosis (EDAS) operation, followed 1 month later by a right EDAS operation. Thereafter, multiple burr-hole trephinations were performed on both occipital areas. However, even after revascularization bypass surgery he still complained of transient ischemic attacks, involuntary choreoathetoid movements, and headache. At the age of 6 years he was admitted for fever of unknown origin. Skin lesions suggestive of Raynaud’s phenomenon developed (Fig. 1F). Together with leukopenia, antinuclear antibody at 1:160 (homogeneous pattern), anti-ds DNA at 93 IU/mL (normal, 0–10 IU/mL), positivity for anticardiolipin antibody IgM (25.8 MPL units) (normal, <20 MPL units), and C3/C4 levels of 58/9 mg/dL (normal, 70–150/10–35 mg/dL) were found. A renal biopsy was performed because of his persistent hematuria, which showed diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis, and so he was diagnosed with SLE and lupus nephritis. Skeletal surveys performed at 9 years of age due to chronic pain in the extremities revealed platyspondyly and metaphyseal dysplasia, suggesting spondyloenchondrodysplasia (Fig. 1C– E). Follow-up neuroimaging findings at the age of 15 years showed an old infarction with cerebromalacia in the left parieto-occipital and both frontal areas, and total obstruction of both the middle and posterior cerebral arteries and distal internal carotid arteries with neovascularization. His older sister developed similar neurological symptoms: MMS (Fig. 1B) and SLE at 8 and 11 years of age, respectively. These skeletal findings prompted us to perform a skeletal dysplasia gene panel, which confirmed compound heterozygous ACP5 variants in the siblings [OMIM*171640, NM_001111035; c.136C>T (p.R46W) and c.449T>A (p. V150E)], which have been reported previously.5 The unaffected parents were heterozygous Jin Sook Lee, Byung Chan Lim Ki Joong Kim, Seung-Ki Kim Ok-Hwa Kim, Joong Gon Kim Sung-Gyoo Park, Tae-Joon Cho Jong-Hee Chae",10.3988/jcn.2019.15.3.407

ACP5,HGNC:124,Spondyloenchondrodysplasia with immune dysregulation,MONDO:0011939,Spondyloenchondrodysplasia Due to Mutation in ACP5 Gene Presenting with Nephrotic Syndrome: A Case Report,"Abstract Spondyloenchondrodysplasia (SPENCD) with immune dysregulation (SPENCDI) is a rare autosomal recessive inherited immuno-osseous dysplasia characterized by spondylo-metaphyseal enchondromas, along with immune dysregulation ranging from immunodeficiency to autoimmune disorder. Here, we present two cousins with ACP5 gene mutation who had severe short stature with mild hypogammaglobulinemia, nephrotic syndrome, autoimmune thyroiditis and cerebral calcification (Case 1); and in the other (Case 2), there was no clinical findings other than severe short stature, CD4+−T cell lymphopenia and non-autoimmune compensated hypothyroidism. We wanted to emphasize that monogenic causes should be considered in the etiology of early-onset nephrotic syndrome due to the detection of a mutation in the ACP5 gene (her actual diagnosis was changed to SPENCDI.) 5 years after the diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome in the first case, and that the renal involvement may occur without SLE in patients with ACP5 mutation. Severe short stature was a common finding in both cases. We underlined that the clinic can be different even in the same mutation, due to the absence of cerebral calcification and renal involvement in the second case, which is a cousin with Case 1. As a result, endocrinologists, immunologists, rheumatologists, nephrologists and orthopedists should be aware of this syndrome, because SPENCDI causes a pleiotropic (due to more than one phenotypic effect of a gene) clinical picture. Severe short stature may be the only presenting sign of patients with SPENCDI. In addition, in the presence of early-onset nephrotic syndrome and autoimmune thyroiditis, the patient should be evaluated for this type of monogenic disorders as well. Zusammenfassung Die Spondyloenchondrodysplasie (SPENCD) mit Immundysregulation (SPENCDI) ist eine seltene, autosomal-rezessiv vererbte immunossäre Dysplasie, die durch spondylo-metaphysäre Enchondrome und eine Immundysregulation gezeichnet ist. Letztere kann von Immunschwäche bis hin zu einer Autoimmunerkrankung reichen. Vorgestellt wird der Fall zweier Cousins mit ACP5-Genmutation. Einer von ihnen (Fall 1) wies einen schweren Kleinwuchs mit leichter Hypogammaglobulinämie, nephrotischem Syndrom, autoimmuner Thyreoiditis und zerebraler Verkalkung auf, während bei dem anderen Patienten (Fall 2) keine weiteren klinischen Befunde außer schwerem Kleinwuchs, CD4-positiver T-Zell-Lymphopenie und nicht autoimmunkompensierter Hypothyreose vorlagen. Bei der Ätiologie des früh einsetzenden nephrotischen Syndroms sollten monogene Ursachen in Betracht gezogen werden, wie sich in Fall 1 zeigt. Hier wurde fünf Jahre nach der Diagnose des nephrotischen Syndroms eine Mutation im ACP5-Gen nachgewiesen, was zur Diagnose SPENCDI führte. Ebenso ist zu berücksichtigen, dass bei Patienten mit ACP5-Mutation auch ohne SLE eine Nierenbeteiligung auftreten kann. Schwerer Kleinwuchs war in beiden Fällen ein häufiger Befund. Zu beachten ist ferner, dass die Klinik auch bei derselben Mutation unterschiedlich sein kann, wie am vorliegenden Beispiel ersichtlich wird. Im zweiten Fall, der mit Fall 1 verwandt ist, lag keine zerebrale Verkalkung und keine Nierenbeteiligung vor. Endokrinologen, Immunologen, Rheumatologen, Nephrologen und Orthopäden sollten sich dieses Syndroms bewusst sein, da SPENCDI ein pleiotropes klinisches Bild hervorruft (verursacht durch mehr als eine phänotypische Wirkung eines Gens). Schwere Kleinwüchsigkeit kann das einzige Symptom von Patienten mit SPENCDI sein. Darüber hinaus sollte der Patient bei Vorliegen eines früh einsetzenden nephrotischen Syndroms und einer Autoimmunthyreoiditis auch auf diese Art von monogenen Erkrankungen untersucht werden.",10.1055/a-1806-0918

ACSF3,HGNC:27288,combined malonic and methylmalonic acidemia,MONDO:0013661,Combined Malonic and Methylmalonic Aciduria Due to ACSF3 Variants Results in Benign Clinical Course in Three Chinese Patients,"Introduction: Combined malonic and methylmalonic aciduria (CMAMMA) is a rare metabolic disease caused by biallelic variants in ACSF3 gene. The clinical phenotype is highly heterogeneous in this disorder, ranging from asymptomatic to severe symptoms. No cases with CMAMMA were reported in China. Materials and Methods: In this study, three Chinese pediatric patients were diagnosed with CMAMMA unexpectedly while being treated for other ailments. To better characterize CMAMMA in a Chinese population, we made a multidimensional analysis with detailed clinical phenotype, semi-quantitative detection of urine organic acid, and analysis of ACSF3 gene variants. Results: The clinical presentation of these patients is quite different; their main complaints were anemia, jaundice, or abnormal urine test, respectively. They showed no symptoms of the classic methylmalonic academia, but urine organic acid analysis showed elevated malonic acid and methylmalonic acid in all the patients repeatedly. Variants were found at four sites in ACSF3 gene. Patient 1 carried the compound heterogeneous variant c.689G> A (p.Trp230*)/c.1456G> A (p.Ala486Thr). A compound heterozygous variant c.473C> T (p.Pro158Leu)/c.1456G> A (p.Ala486Thr) was identified in patient 2. Patient 3 harbored a novel homozygous variant c.1447A> G (p.Lys483Glu). Conclusions: Three Chinese patients were diagnosed with CMAMMA caused by ACSF3 variants. Their clinical course revealed that CMAMMA can be a benign condition that does not affect individual growth and development, but severe clinical phenotype may appear when other triggers exist. This study systematically elaborates CMAMMA in a Chinese population for the first time, broadens the spectrum of gene variant, and provides a strong basis for the etiological study of this disorder.",10.3389/fped.2021.751895

A 52-day-old infant with a fever and a history of possible meningitis during the neonatal period was hospitalized. Multiple lesions of necrotizing lymphadenitis with abscesses in the left inguinal area were treated by incision and drainage along with appropriate antibiotic therapy, which revealed a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection. At 6 months of age, the patient was admitted with anal abscesses. Due to the increased suspicion of primary immunodeficiency disease, genetic testing was conducted, which revealed ACSF3 biallelic variants inherited from both parents. Urine organic acid analysis revealed elevated levels of malonic and methylmalonic acids. At 29 months, the patient showed normal growth and development without any dietary modifications.

We report on a 10‐year‐old male patient with moderate intellectual disability, sensorineural hearing loss, facial dysmorphism, pyloric stenosis, and intestinal obstruction in whom a de novo Xq22.3–q23 deletion was detected by SNP array analysis. The deleted 1.56 Mb interval harbored ACSL4 and eight neighboring genes (GUCY2F, NXT2, KCNE1L, TMEM164, MIR3978, AMMECR1, SNORD96B, and RGAG1). In contrast to previously reported patients with chromosome aberrations in the region of the AMME complex (Alport syndrome, intellectual disability, midface hypoplasia, and elliptocytosis, OMIM 300194), this deletion did not contain the Alport syndrome gene COL4A5, suggesting that loss of one or several of the other genes in this interval is responsible for the clinical problems. In summary, the patient reported here broadens our knowledge of the phenotypic consequences of deletions of chromosome region Xq22.3–q23 and provides further proof for ACSL4 as an X‐linked intellectual disability gene. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",10.1002/ajmg.a.35778
ACSL4,HGNC:3571,non-syndromic X-linked intellectual disability,MONDO:0019181,Non‐syndromic X linked intellectual disability: Current knowledge in light of the recent advances in molecular and functional studies,"Since the discovery of the FMR1 gene and the clinical and molecular characterization of Fragile X Syndrome in 1991, more than 141 genes have been identified in the X‐chromosome in these 28 years thanks to applying continuously evolving molecular techniques to X‐linked intellectual disability (XLID) families. In the past decade, array comparative genomic hybridization and next generation sequencing technologies have accelerated gene discovery exponentially. Classically, XLID has been subdivided in syndromic intellectual disability (S‐XLID)—where intellectual disability (ID) is always associated with other recognizable physical and/or neurological features—and non‐specific or non‐syndromic intellectual disability (NS‐XLID) where the only common feature is ID. Nevertheless, new advances on the study of these entities have showed that this classification is not always clear‐cut because distinct variants in several of these XLID genes can result in S‐XLID as well as in NS‐XLID. This review focuses on the current knowledge on the XLID genes involved in non‐syndromic forms, with the emphasis on their pathogenic mechanism, thus allowing the possibility to elucidate why some of them can give both syndromic and non‐syndromic phenotypes.",10.1111/cge.13698

Among the numerous genes found to be involved in the pathogenesis of intellectual disability, 10% are located on the X-chromosome. We identified a missense mutation (c.236 C > G; p.S79W) in the SYN1 gene coding for synapsin I in the MRX50 family, affected by non-syndromic X-linked intellectual disability. Synapsin I is a neuronal phosphoprotein involved in the regulation of neurotransmitter release and neuronal development. Several mutations in SYN1 have been identified in patients affected by epilepsy and/or autism. The S79W mutation segregates with the disease in the MRX50 family and all affected members display intellectual disability as sole clinical manifestation. At the protein level, the S79W Synapsin I mutation is located in the region of the B-domain involved in recognition of highly curved membranes. Expression of human S79W Synapsin I in Syn1 knockout hippocampal neurons causes aberrant accumulation of small clear vesicles in the soma, increased clustering of synaptic vesicles at presynaptic terminals and increased frequency of excitatory spontaneous release events. In addition, the presence of S79W Synapsin I strongly reduces the mobility of synaptic vesicles, with possible implications for the regulation of neurotransmitter release and synaptic plasticity. These results implicate SYN1 in the pathogenesis of non-syndromic intellectual disability, showing that alterations of synaptic vesicle trafficking are one possible cause of this disease, and suggest that distinct mutations in SYN1 may lead to distinct brain pathologies.",10.1093/hmg/ddx352

This discovery was revealed by a combination of large-scale resequencing of the X chromosome, and key functional assays that revealed a reduction, but not elimination, of IQSEC2 GEF activity for mutations affecting conserved amino acids in the IQ-like and Sec7 domains. Compromised GTP binding activity of IQSEC2 leading to reduced activation of selected Arf substrates (Arf1, Arf6) is expected to impact on cytoskeletal organization, dendritic spine morphology and synaptic organisation. This study highlights the need for further investigation of the IQSEC gene family and Arf GTPases in neuronal morphology and synaptic function, and suggests that the genes encoding the ArfGEFs IQSEC1 and IQSEC3 should be considered as candidates for screening in autosomal ID.",10.4161/sgtp.1.2.13285

Diagnosis of XLID, especially for non-syndromic ones (NS-XLID), is often hampered by the heterogeneity of this disease. Here we report the case of a Chinese family in which three males suffer from intellectual disability (ID). The three patients shared the same phenotype: no typical clinical manifestation other than IQ score ≤ 70. For a genetic diagnosis for this family we carried out whole exome sequencing on the proband, and validated 16 variants of interest in the genomic DNA of all the family members. A missense mutation (c.710G > T), which mapped to exon 6 of the Rab GDP-Dissociation Inhibitor 1 (GDI1) gene, was found segregating with the ID phenotype, and this mutation changes the 237th position in the guanosine diphosphate dissociation inhibitor (GDI) protein from glycine to valine (p. Gly237Val). Through molecular dynamics simulations we found that this substitution results in a conformational change of GDI, possibly affecting the Rab-binding capacity of this protein. In conclusion, our study identified a novel GDI1 mutation that is possibly NS-XLID causative, and showed that whole exome sequencing provides advantages for detecting novel ID-associated variants and can greatly facilitate the genetic diagnosis of the disease.",10.1590/1678-4685-GMB-2016-0249

The objective of this study was to develop a clinical trait-imaging fusion model that combines preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) radiomics and deep learning (DL) features with clinical variables to predict ATRX status in isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-mutant high-grade astrocytoma. Methods A total of 234 patients with IDH-mutant high-grade astrocytoma (120 ATRX mutant type, 114 ATRX wild type) from 3 centers were retrospectively analyzed. Radiomics and DL features from different regions (edema, tumor, and the overall lesion) were extracted to construct multiple imaging models by combining different features in different regions for predicting ATRX status. An optimal imaging model was then selected, and its features and linear coefficients were used to calculate an imaging score. Finally, a fusion model was developed by combining the imaging score and clinical variables. The performance and application value of the fusion model were evaluated through the comparison of receiver operating characteristic curves, the construction of a nomogram, calibration curves, decision curves, and clinical application curves. Results The overall hybrid model constructed with radiomics and DL features from the overall lesion was identified as the optimal imaging model. The fusion model showed the best prediction performance with an area under curve of 0.969 in the training set, 0.956 in the validation set, and 0.949 in the test set as compared to the optimal imaging model (0.966, 0.916, and 0.936, respectively) and clinical model (0.677, 0.641, 0.772, respectively). Conclusions The clinical trait-imaging fusion model based on preoperative MRI could effectively predict the ATRX mutation status of individuals with IDH-mutant high-grade astrocytoma and has the potential to help patients through the development of a more effective treatment strategy before treatment.",10.21037/qims-23-807

This article delves into the complex challenges encountered by an individual with intellectual disability, particularly examining the interplay between cognitive limitations and speech difficulties, while presenting a case report detailing the experience of a son within a non-consanguineous family diagnosed with intellectual disability due to a new genetic defect in THOC2, thereby contributing significantly to our comprehension of THOC2-related pathogenic variants. Case presentation: A 14-year-old boy from a non-consanguineous Iranian family presented with significant challenges in academics, communication, and adaptive skills, accompanied by speech problems and exhibiting distinctive physical characteristics. The exome-sequencing analysis revealed a novel hemizygous c.1559+5A>T mutation located in intron 14 (NM_001081550.2) within the THOC2 gene in the proband. Sanger sequencing further confirmed the mother as a carrier of the mutation, although she remains in good health, while the father exhibits a normal genotype. This delineates an X-linked inheritance pattern, shedding light on the familial transmission of the identified genetic anomaly. Conclusion: The precise identification of the c.1559+5A>T splicing mutation in the THOC2 gene, achieved through exome-sequencing, conclusively diagnoses X-linked intellectual disability in our patient. This breakthrough not only unravels the molecular intricacies contributing to intellectual disability but also underscores the urgency for accurate and swift disease diagnosis.",10.21103/article14(2)_cr5

Neurodevelopmental disorders with intellectual disability (ND/ID) are a heterogeneous group of diseases driving lifelong deficits in cognition and behavior with no definitive cure. X-linked intellectual disability disorder 105 (XLID105, #300984; OMIM) is a ND/ID driven by hemizygous variants in the USP27X gene encoding a protein deubiquitylase with a role in cell proliferation and neural development. Currently, only four genetically diagnosed individuals from two unrelated families have been described with limited clinical data. Furthermore, the mechanisms underlying the disorder are unknown. Here, we report 10 new XLID105 individuals from nine families and determine the impact of gene variants on USP27X protein function. Using a combination of clinical genetics, bioinformatics, biochemical, and cell biology approaches, we determined that XLID105 variants alter USP27X protein biology via distinct mechanisms including changes in developmentally relevant protein–protein interactions and deubiquitylating activity. Our data better define the phenotypic spectrum of XLID105 and suggest that XLID105 is driven by USP27X functional disruption. Understanding the pathogenic mechanisms of XLID105 variants will provide molecular insight into USP27X biology and may create the potential for therapy development.",10.26508/lsa.202302258

Herein, we described a Thai family with six patients who had severe-to-profound intellectual impairment, limited verbal communication, and varying degrees of limb spasticity. One patient had a unilateral cataract. We demonstrated facial evolution over time, namely coarse facies, long faces, and thick lip vermilions. We identified a novel AP1S2 variant, c.1-2A>G. The mRNA analysis revealed that the variant resulted in splicing defects with leaky splicing, yielding two distinct aberrant transcripts, one of which likely resulting in the mutant protein lacking the first 44 amino acids whereas the other possibly leading to no production of the protein. By performing a literature review, we found 51 patients and 11 AP1S2 pathogenic alleles described and that all the variants were loss-of-function alleles. The severity of ID in Pettigrew syndrome is mostly severe-to-profound (54.8%), followed by moderate (26.2%) and mild. Progressive spasticity was noted in multiple patients. In summary, leaky splicing found in the present family was likely related to the intrafamilial clinical variability. Our data also support the previous notion of variable expression and neuroprogressive nature of the disorder.",10.1002/ajmg.a.63639

ACSL4,HGNC:3571,"intellectual disability, X-linked 63",MONDO:0010313,Eye movement defects in KO zebrafish reveals SRPK3 as a causative gene for an X-linked intellectual disability,"Intellectual disability (ID) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by significantly impaired intellectual and adaptive functioning. X-linked ID (XLID) disorders, caused by defects in genes on the X chromosome, affect 1.7 out of 1,000 males. Employing exome sequencing, we identified three missense mutations (c.475C>G; p.H159D, c.1373C>A; p.T458N, and c.1585G>A; p.E529K) in the SRPK3 gene in seven XLID patients from three independent families. Clinical features common to the patients are intellectual disability, agenesis of the corpus callosum, abnormal smooth pursuit eye movement, and ataxia. SRPK proteins are known to be involved in mRNA processing and, recently, synaptic vesicle and neurotransmitter release. In order to validate SRPK3 as a novel XLID gene, we established a knockout (KO) model of the SRPK3 orthologue in zebrafish. In day 5 of larval stage, KO zebrafish showed significant defects in spontaneous eye movement and swim bladder inflation. In adult KO zebrafish, we found agenesis of cerebellar structures and impairments in social interaction. These results suggest an important role of SRPK3 in eye movements, which might reflect learning problems, intellectual disability, and other psychiatric disorders.",10.21203/rs.3.rs-2683050/v1
ACSL4,HGNC:3571,"intellectual disability, X-linked 63",MONDO:0010313,Novel variants in the CLCN4 gene associated with syndromic X-linked intellectual disability,"Objective The dysfunction of the CLCN4 gene can lead to X-linked intellectual disability and Raynaud–Claes syndrome (MRXSRC), characterized by severe cognitive impairment and mental disorders. This study aimed to investigate the genetic defects and clinical features of Chinese children with CLCN4 variants and explore the effect of mutant ClC-4 on the protein expression level and subcellular localization through in vitro experiments. Methods A total of 401 children with intellectual disabilities were screened for genetic variability using whole-exome sequencing (WES). Clinical data, including age, sex, perinatal conditions, and environmental exposure, were collected. Cognitive, verbal, motor, and social behavioral abilities were evaluated. Candidate variants were verified using Sanger sequencing, and their pathogenicity and conservation were analyzed using in silico prediction tools. Protein expression and localization of mutant ClC-4 were measured using Western blotting (WB) and immunofluorescence microscopy. The impact of a splice site variant was assessed with a minigene assay. Results Exome analysis identified five rare CLCN4 variants in six unrelated patients with intellectual disabilities, including two recurrent heterozygous de novo missense variants (p.D89N and p.A555V) in three female patients, and two hemizygous missense variants (p.N141S and p.R694Q) and a splicing variant (c.1390-12T > G) that are maternally inherited in three male patients. The p.N141S variant and the splicing variant c.1390-12(T > G were novel, while p.R694Q was identified in two asymptomatic heterozygous female patients. The six children with CLCN4 variants exhibited a neurodevelopmental spectrum disease characterized by intellectual disability (ID), delayed speech, autism spectrum disorders (ASD), microcephaly, hypertonia, and abnormal imaging findings. The minigene splicing result indicated that the c.1390-12T > G did not affect the splicing of CLCN4 mRNA. In vitro experiments showed that the mutant protein level and localization of mutant protein are similar to the wild type. Conclusion The study identified six probands with CLCN4 gene variants associated with X-linked ID. It expanded the gene and phenotype spectrum of CLCN4 variants. The bioinformatic analysis supported the pathogenicity of CLCN4 variants. However, these CLCN4 gene variants did not affect the ClC-4 expression levels and protein location, consistent with previous studies. Further investigations are necessary to investigate the pathogenetic mechanism.",10.3389/fneur.2023.1096969

ACSL4,HGNC:3571,"intellectual disability, X-linked 63",MONDO:0010313,Alpha Thalassemia/Intellectual Disability X-Linked Deficiency Sensitizes Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer to Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors,"Background The immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have achieved great success in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. However, the response rate is low. The molecular mechanism involved in the effectiveness of ICIs remains to be elucidated. Methods ATRX mutation incidence among human cancers was analyzed from TCGA database. Atrx-deficient Lewis lung cancer cell line (LLC-sgAtrx) was established via AAV-CRISPR. Subcutaneous and metastasis models were established by subcutaneous and intravenous injection of LLC-sgAtrx and LLC-sgNTC cells into female C57BL/6 mice. The mice were treated with anti-PD1, anti-CLTA4 or Rat IgG2a. Tumor volume was determined by Vernier calipers and the IVIS imaging system. The proportions of CD3+ T cells, CD45+ immune cells, and the expression of pMHC I and PDL1 were determined by flow cytometry. The T cell cytotoxicity was determined by co-culture experiment. Results TCGA data showed that Atrx is a tumor suppressor mutated at high frequency among various human cancers. The tumor volume of mice bearing LLC-sgAtrx was significantly shrinked and the median survival of mice was significantly longer after anti-PD1 and anti-CTLA4 treatment. Flowcytometry results showed that Atrx deficiency increase the penetration of CD3+ T cell into the tumor microenvironment and enhanced antigen presentation after IFNγ stimulation. Additionally, the tumor cells with Atrx deficiency were more easily to be damaged by T cells under IFNγ stimulation. Conclusion The present study demonstrated that Atrx deficiency sensitize lung cancer cells to ICIs by multiple mechanisms. And ATRX may serve as a promising biomarker for ICIs which helps patient stratification and decision making.",10.3389/fonc.2020.608300

The new genes were identified by sequencing of candidate genes (2), the entire X‐chromosome (2), the whole exome (15), or the whole genome (2). With these additions, 42 (21%) of the 199 named XLID syndromes and 27 (25%) of the 108 numbered nonsyndromic XLID families remain to be resolved at the molecular level. Although the pace of discovery of new XLID genes has slowed during the past 5 years, the density of genes on the X chromosome that cause intellectual disability still appears to be twice the density of intellectual disability genes on the autosomes.",10.1002/ajmg.a.63008
