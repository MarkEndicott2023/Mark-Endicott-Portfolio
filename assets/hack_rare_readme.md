Background & Motivation

Why This Matters for Drug Discovery

Gain of Function: If the disease mechanism is an overactive protein, inhibitors or antagonists can be designed to dial down or block that activity.

Loss of Function: If a gene is underactive or null, protein replacement, gene therapy, or molecules that enhance residual function can be pursued.

Dominant Negative: Understanding how the mutant protein disrupts the wild-type form can guide molecule design to prevent detrimental protein–protein interactions.
Key Benefit

Mechanism-informed drug design streamlines the search for effective treatments by precisely targeting the root cause of a rare disease.
